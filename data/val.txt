r 2019 NAND supply bit growth to be meaningfully reduced from prior expectations, and expect our bit shipment growth to be in line with the industry demand at approximately 35%. We also expect NAND demand to accelerate in the second half of the calendar year, as demand elasticity kicks in for the mobile, enterprise and client markets. Given our attractive cost structure on leading-edge NAND and DRAM, in this market environment, we will manage pricing and carry inventory as necessary to optimize our profitability. We are taking decisive action on the supply side to manage our business in a prudent fashion, with an eye towards delivering a robust return on our investments. Our actions will significantly reduce our fiscal 2019 CapEx and allow us to continue delivering strong profitability and healthy free cash flow, while investing in our strategic priorities as we position Micron to capitalize on the exciting growth opportunities for the company.
I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide financial details of our fiscal first quarter and guidance for the second quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner, Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Sanjay. Micron delivered strong results in our fiscal first quarter, including double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue, gross profits, and earnings per share. While our near-term outlook has become more challenging, the actions taken to improve our cost structure and increase our mix of high-value solutions, will ensure that our profitability profile remains strong. Moreover, Micron's financial position remains healthy, with an improved net cash position and with total liquidity reaching our target levels.
Total fiscal first quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, up 16% from the prior year, and down 6% from the record fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue was adversely impacted by inventory adjustments at key customers in the cloud, graphics and enterprise markets. Offsetting these headwinds, we delivered record revenue in the mobile, industrial and automotive markets. DRAM represented 68% of total company revenue in the fiscal first quarter. DRAM revenue increased 18% year-over-year and declined 9% from the prior quarter.
On a blended basis, DRAM ASPs declined high single digits percent compared to the prior quarter, while shipment quantities were relatively flat. Trade NAND revenue represented 28% of total company revenue in the fiscal first quarter. Trade NAND revenue increased 17% year-over-year and declined 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our overall NAND ASP declined in the low- to mid-teens percent, and shipment quantities increased in the low to mid-teens percent, compared to the prior quarter.
Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $3.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year and down 17% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline was driven by the impact of inventory adjustments at some of our customers in the graphics, enterprise and cloud markets. The Mobile Business Unit delivered a strong quarter, with record revenue of $2.2 billion, revenue increased 62% year-over-year and 17% from the prior quarter. Revenue growth was driven by the continued strength of our low-power DRAM offerings, and share gains in our mobile managed NAND business with several leading handset customers.
Embedded Business Unit revenue of $933 million was up 12% year-on-year, and up 1% quarter-on-quarter. The automotive and industrial business -- businesses had record revenue, driven by strong sales of our DRAM and NOR products.
And finally, turning to the Storage Business Unit, or SBU, fiscal first quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, down 17% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline in revenue was driven by weaker pricing and the ongoing transition from SATA to NVMe SSDs. The impact of this transition will continue through calendar 2019. Our strategy to move bits from SBU components to high-value solutions in mobile is also contributing to a decline in revenue for SBU.
The consolidated gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 59%, up 360 basis points from the prior year, and down approximately 230 basis points from the prior quarter. This includes a 120 basis point impact from 3D XPoint underutilization costs.
During the last few months, we successfully leveraged our global supply chain to mitigate the impact of the China trade tariffs to less than 50 basis points to our consolidated fiscal first quarter gross margin. We expect to be able to mitigate approximately 90% of the impact from tariffs starting in January 2019. We believe that Micron will not be directly impacted by any expansion of trade tariffs to additional product categories.
Operating expenses were $783 million, slightly above our guidance, mainly due to higher-than-expected prequalification expenses associated with new product introductions.
Looking forward, as our joint development work with Intel comes to a conclusion around the end of this fiscal year, the R&D cost-sharing between the companies will naturally reduce and come to an end. In the fiscal first quarter, Intel's share of joint R&D expenses was approximately $30 million. We expect that our R&D expenses will continue to increase in the coming quarters, due to the combination of these declining R&D contributions from Intel, as well as increased investments in future technologies and high-value solutions across our portfolio. We continue to drive strong profitability in the fiscal first quarter, with operating income of $3.9 billion, representing 49% of revenue. This margin is up 3 percentage points year-over-year and down 3 percentage points from the fiscal fourth quarter.
As previously mentioned, the improvements that Micron has made over the prior several years have resulted in structurally higher margins. The tax rate for the fiscal first quarter was 10%, and we expect our fiscal year 2019 tax rate to be around 11%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fiscal first quarter totaled $2.97, up from $2.45 in the year ago quarter and down from $3.53 in the prior quarter. We commenced our capital return program in the fiscal first quarter with the repurchase of $1.8 billion of common stock, representing a reduction of approximately 42 million shares or about 3.5% of shares outstanding. We expect to remain active with our stock buybacks in the fiscal second quarter, as we continue to make progress on our $10 billion repurchase program by returning at least 50% of our ongoing free cash flows to shareholders.
Turning to cash flows and capital spending. In the fiscal first quarter, we generated $4.8 billion in cash from operations, representing 61% of revenue. Capital spending, net of third-party contributions, was $2.5 billion, up from $2.1 billion in the prior quarter. In the fiscal first quarter, our free cash flow was approximately $2.3 billion, up about $600 million from the year ago quarter, and down approximately $750 million from the prior quarter. We deployed approximately 80% of the quarter's free cash flow towards our share repurchase program. Even with the substantial outlay for share repurchases, we ended the fiscal quarter in a record net cash position of $3.1 billion, with approximately $7.2 billion in cash, marketable investments and restricted cash, and $4.1 billion in debt. While we largely completed our deleveraging activities in fiscal year 2018, we further reduced our debt balance in the quarter by approximately $500 million through the settlement of outstanding convertible note redemptions of $160 million and other scheduled payments.
Overall, our solid balance sheet, strong cash flow, and robust liquidity put us in an excellent position to execute on our capital returns program.
Prior to issuing our fiscal second quarter guidance, I'd like to provide some context for our outlook. Due to the weaker demand environment, we expect fiscal second quarter sequential bit shipments to be down meaningfully for both NAND and DRAM. Given the weaker near-term outlook, we are lowering our CapEx plans to a range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion for fiscal 2019. At the midpoint, this represents a $1.25 billion reduction from our prior guidance, and our front-end equipment CapEx is now down year-on-year. We'll continue to remain flexible with capital spending to respond to market conditions.
With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal second quarter is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.3 billion; and gross margins to be in the range of 50% to 53%; operating expenses are expected to be $800 million, plus or minus $25 million. As we execute on longer-term growth investments, we're actively managing OpEx by implementing expense controls across the company, including tighter controls on headcount, holiday work schedule slowdowns and reductions in discretionary spending. Based on a share count of approximately 1.15 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.75, plus or minus $0.10.
In closing, Micron continues to deliver solid financial results on a stronger performance foundation. We are making progress on all of our key initiatives, including our high-value solutions product portfolio, our cost profile, capital return program, and financial structure, with a record net cash position, and $9.7 billion of liquidity at the end of the fiscal first quarter. While near-term market conditions are challenging, we are taking appropriate steps to manage production and spending, in order to deliver healthy profitability and cash flows. There is no doubt Micron remains in the strongest financial position in the company's history, as we transition to next-generation technologies and products.
I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks.

Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Dave. While we end calendar 2018 on the heels of unprecedented profitability and revenue for both Micron and the industry, we do believe we are entering a period of weaker market conditions. We are taking prudent actions to adapt our manufacturing plans to the changing demand environment. While we are implementing expense controls, we are also continuing to invest in our technology and cost competitiveness, as well as strengthening our portfolio of high-value solutions. Memory and storage have become essential ingredients to the value created by the data economy, and it is this added value that is driving a virtual cycle of long-term growth and innovation. We continue to believe that the memory industry is structurally stronger, with more diversified demand drivers and moderating supply growth capability. Micron is better positioned than ever before to win in this environment with our strong balance sheet and the structural improvements we have made to our operating model in the past several years. We believe 2019 will be a year of solid profitability, and I look forward to sharing our results over the quarters ahead. We will now open for questions.

Questions and Answers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Sanjay, I was wondering if you could help quantify the inventory at your big hyper scale customers? It sounds like in aggregate it's maybe 2 months. So I'm wondering if you can help with that number?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So inventory at our customers and this is -- customers in various segments of our market, some of those customers are carrying higher levels of inventory, and that inventory level varies from customer to customer, we believe. And our assessment is that inventory adjustments will take couple of quarters for it to be corrected, for it to work through the system entirely and, of course, we continue to work with our customers in the meantime, in terms of understanding their longer-term demand requirements. And, certainly, our customers are indicating optimism towards the demand requirements in the second half of the year, and especially, as inventory adjustments work through the system and as supply cuts, the effect of those come through the industry, as well as second half of the calendar year tends to be seasonally stronger, compared to the first half of the year, we do expect that by the second half of the year, we'll have an environment that will be improved, stronger, compared to the first half of the year. And just keep in mind that the long-term demand trends in our end markets of cloud, client, enterprise, graphics, all of these end markets, the trends continue to be strong, needing more memory and more storage ultimately. We're just going through an air pocket here, related to primarily inventory adjustments, as well as some seasonal, weak mobile demand, including mobile demand on the high-end smartphones that is impacting some of our near-term visibility, as well as the near-term outlook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And then I guess just as a quick follow-up, Dave. So I think maybe the surprise in the guidance is that the bit shipments are down, I think you said, meaningfully for both NAND and DRAM. I'm wondering, what that means for inventories? Are you going to ship out of inventory? Or are you cutting utilization? Can you sort of walk us through that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner, Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So we are reducing our production for both DRAM and NAND. As Sanjay indicated, from a DRAM perspective, we're bringing bit supply growth down to 15% approximately in calendar year 2019. For NAND, we're also bringing the production down meaningfully, and we did indicate that we would ship close to demand for NAND, and we think that demand is about 35%. So, obviously, there will be periods of time where we do have inventory increasing for some period of time and then, of course, it will adjust down through the years as we -- as those demand and supply numbers get more aligned. In the first quarter, we had days of inventory up to 107 days, I'm very comfortable with 107 days. This is very low cost product that we're putting on the balance sheet. There is no risk around obsolescence, it's part -- it's very likely that it will go up again next quarter. Again, I'm very comfortable with that. But I think over the long term, we'll have it more aligned with ultimately where we want it to be.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question will come from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dave, just relative to the guidance for OpEx in February quarter of $800 million, plus or minus $25 million, does that now reflect what we should think about as a fully burdened OpEx as you kind of move away from the shared cost with Intel? And relative to the $6 billion of operational efficiency gains you talked about at the Analyst Day this past summer, how does that fit in with this OpEx guide? Because this is about $200 million more OpEx per quarter than we saw at similar revenue levels back in sort of '16, '17, and it's about $300 million above per quarter what we saw kind of in the '15 sort of correction?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner, Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, good question. So we did guide $800 million for OpEx in the second quarter, plus or minus $25 million. That's probably -- that's certainly not fully burdened. We had about $30 million of benefit in the first fiscal quarter related to Intel's contribution through R&D expenses. It will be a little bit less in the second quarter, but over the course of the rest of the year, it will kind of phase down. So that certainly will elevate the OpEx in the third and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter. And also, we're not -- while we are certainly managing expenses prudently and we are taking steps in terms of reducing discretionary spending and just monitoring our head count very closely, we still are making the necessary investments on the product side and the non-technology side. This is as Sanjay mentioned, and air pocket, we don't want to in any way, impact our long term strategy for some sort of near-term event. So OpEx will likely go up a little bit. It's a fair point on the OpEx. I would say, if you look at the guidance for the second quarter or even with the revenue guidance we gave relative to what the first quarter was like, if you take the kind of midpoint of the earnings number, and the midpoint of the revenue guidance number, you'll get kind of 38% plus operating margin. So that is a really good number obviously. It's a number of, in my previous company, we were kind of aspirationally trying to get to. So it's a very good operation -- operating margin number. And I think it reflects the fact that we achieved the $6 billion of improvements that we said we would make at the Analyst Day. We still think we have more work to do in terms of driving the mix towards high-value solutions in terms of improving our cost competitiveness, both on the front-end and on the back-end side. So there is more to come, there is another $3 billion that we committed, and we feel very good about that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And then as my follow-up for Sanjay. Can you just walk us through the strategic puts and takes of building inventory into the February quarter, as opposed to trying to let those bits out into the marketplace and let elasticity sort of take over? Is this sort of intangible reflection of your view that this will be relatively short-lived a couple of quarters? And what would you need to see before you would think that inventory build was too risky?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I think our inventory, our cost structure is very good, both on DRAM as well as on the NAND side. And so we are definitely prepared that in terms of managing our overall profitability, which is absolutely our primary focus, that we'll manage pricing and manage inventory accordingly, as necessary. If inventor has to be carried over, we will carry it over, because the demand in NAND will kick in with elasticity. In DRAM, the inventory consumption with our customers will occur, supply cuts will be driving return to stronger demand environment, compared to -- in the second half, compared to first half. So we will be using inventory as a lever to ultimately manage for the best profitability of the company. And certainly, be prepared, use that inventory as necessary to also capitalize on the second half opportunities. And our focus really will also remain that in terms of our CAGR, in terms of output growth, to be aligned with the demand CAGR. And we'll, of course, from time-to-time, use inventory as a lever to manage the profitability of our business and, of course, manage our customers' requirements as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question will come from C. J. Muse with Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess, first question, can you talk about what you're thinking in terms of cost down efforts both for DRAM and NAND, particularly as you move to higher-value solutions, changing mix, including 1Y, 1Z, as well as 96 layers in the '19 time frame?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With respect to the cost structure, we continue to be in very good position, as we said, that for our fiscal year '19, we'll have healthy cost reductions, both for NAND as well as DRAM. And you're, of course, right to note that as we increase the mix of our high-value solutions, for example, over the longer term as we increase our SSD mix or increase our managed NAND solutions, those do tend to incur higher costs. But they also bring higher margins, higher profitability, higher pricing associated with them as well. So cost wise, we are in good shape.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's helpful. And I guess, as a follow-up, a question for you, Dave. I think in the past you've talked about wanting to have liquidity, including gross cash and revolver, of roughly 1 year CapEx, which would basically put you on the screws here. So the question is, how to think about incremental free cash flow generation? And what percentage of that would be used for buybacks?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner, Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, good question, C.J. So, we contribute -- let's start with the -- we're at about $9.7 billion of liquidity when you count the cash that we have on the balance sheet, plus the $2.5 billion revolver we have. So we're in, as you point out, very good shape relative to where our target at liquidity would be. You saw a pretty healthy return of cash to shareholders in the first quarter. About 80% of our free cash flow went to shareholders in the form of the buyback, and really, the rest went to further deleverage the balance sheet. There's not a ton of deleveraging that will go on through the rest of the year, quite honestly. And so I would expect us to be -- continue to be good buyers of the stock, so to speak, through the next 3 quarters, and contribute a high portion of our free cash flow in the form of a buyback.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question will come from Mark Newman with Bernstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark C. Newman, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First question really, I'd like to ask on the supply adjustments you're making, you're taking down the guidance for both DRAM and NAND production. You mentioned about some of that being inventory, but you also mentioned some of that being some reduction adjustments. It would be useful to understand a bit more about that. For example, is that reduction of utilization? Is that a no more capacity additions? Or what is that? Because some of your competitors have been pushing out some of their capacity additions. And so it would be useful to understand what Micron is doing here on the capacity adjustments to get this slightly lower bit growth that you are forecasting for calendar '19?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, certainly, we are taking actions, a range of actions, and we won't really get into any specifics here in terms of what actions we are taking to reduce our output. You earlier mentioned about inventory. I mean, of course, we will carry inventory as necessary to manage the profitability. But important thing to understand is that we are taking decisive actions in terms of reducing our production output, both in NAND as well as in DRAM. And that's the contributor to the $1.25 billion reduction in CapEx, compared to our prior guidance. And, of course, our intention here is to align our supply output in line with the industry demand trends. And we feel very good about the actions we have taken. In DRAM, we've pointed out that compared to our prior expectations of 20% supply bit growth in calendar 2019, we have taken actions now to reduce our output to provide a 15% supply output growth on a year-over-year basis. And in DRAM as well, we have taken actions to adjust our output so that our shipments will match with our demand that we expect to be around 35% in 2019. And I just wanted to make it very clear here -- and I just want to be very clear as we have always said, that we are not adding any new wafer capacity. We are -- the CapEx that we discussed today, the lowered CapEx that we discussed, which on a wafer equipment basis is a reduction from fiscal year '18 CapEx, is all going towards technology transitions only. And that, of course, is the best way to achieve the ROI on those investments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark C. Newman, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So does that mean slower technology migration? Or does it perhaps mean slightly lower utilization for a temporary period?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, Mark, I'm not going to get into the specifics. Most important thing is, we have managed our CapEx lower, and we continue to take actions to manage our production output lower to align our supply with our demand expectations. And I think the effect of these actions will in fact, some of these actions will start showing as early as this quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark C. Newman, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks Sanjay and then...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner, Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And if you look at our gross margin guidance. Go ahead, sorry Mark.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark C. Newman, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All right, go ahead. You go ahead, Dave, first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner, Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was just going to say, if you look at our gross margin guidance, it would reflect that we have a very good cost structure for our products.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And the reduction of these output that we are talking about, our cost structure will remain in very good shape, even with that. And in fact, in terms of cost, on a year-over-year basis, we actually, our cost reductions we believe both in DRAM and NAND, will be above the industry. Cost reductions remain above the industry, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark C. Newman, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My follow-up question is on the demand. You talked about this a little bit of an inventory correction amongst customers, some of your competitors have talked a bit about that as well. But you seem to be reasonably confident that demand is going to come back second half of calendar '19, which also suggests that the inventory should have been burnt up by then. The customer's inventory should have been used up mostly by then. It would just be helpful, do you have any data points to explain how you get that confidence that demand will come back? Is it perhaps on the NAND side more about demand elasticity? Is it on the DRAM side? Anything about the kind of magnitude of the inventory level the customers have today to give us some kind of sense that -- confidence that, that would've been used up within a couple of quarters, for example? That'll be great, that would be very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So first of all, I think we should realize that the end market demand trends, by and large, really remain quite healthy and our customers also are absolutely continuing to show to us the optimism around the long-term demand trends. And as we noted in my remarks, that in our fiscal second quarter, the bits for DRAM, let me first talk about DRAM here, the bits for DRAM will be down on a year-over-year basis, and this needs to be compared with the long-term DRAM demand CAGR of 20%, high teens to 20% range. So, when in FQ2, on a year-over-year basis, you reduction and you contrast it with the long-term demand trends of 20% kind of demand growth, then it tells you that during fiscal second quarter, a lot of the inventory adjustments will certainly be occurring. And that's why we say that it will take couple of quarters for inventory adjustments to occur. So again, the point about year-over-year reduction in our DRAM shipments is an important point in understanding that the inventory adjustment by our customers is well underway. And all of this, while the end market demand drivers of cloud, as you see from all the data, is absolutely continuing to be healthy, the end market demand driver in terms of average capacity increases of flash and smartphones, as well as DRAM content and smartphones driven by AI and machine learning, continues to be on the upward trend. And of course, applications like automotive and industrial IoT, with more AI and more machine learning, all of these are continuing to drive the demand trends toward a need for more storage and more memory. And we laid out some of these opportunities at our Investor Day, and all of those opportunities very much stay intact, and at the end market level, continue to be vibrant. So, I think these couple of points that the November quarter itself was, in terms of overall shipment, was below seasonal, as well as the first quarter, on a year-over-year basis, really showing reduction, points to inventory adjustments are well underway. And, of course, you have to look at this in the backdrop that the output in the industry is coming down as well. We have announced our decisive actions here today, and we have provided the outlook in terms of our output growth in calendar year '19, both for NAND as well as DRAM. So these -- and then, as I said before, that second half of the year tends to be a seasonally stronger part in terms of demand compared to the first half. So these all are definitely pointing to our confidence, and built up on inputs from our customers in terms of second half of the year being stronger than the first half of the year in terms of -- in demand trends and the industry fundamentals as well. And let me just point out one more thing here, that when you look at industry, I mean, compared to the past cycles, really the CapEx cuts are happening at much, much earlier level in the cycle. And really, in terms of happening even at much higher levels of profitability than ever in the past. So all this, overall, I believe, bodes well for the long term fundamentals of the industry as well as, certainly, for Micron.

Operator [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Christopher Rakers, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was wondering if I could build on that last comment, you've talked a lot about your own plans in terms of curtailing your capacity expansion this year. But given that you are in off quarter, off calendar quarter, I'm just curious of how you will characterize maybe the competitive landscape, maybe what you've seen change over the last month and a half or so, relative to some of your competitors in the context of both DRAM and NAND? And I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think in that regard, you know as much as I do, and over the course of last couple of months, there have been a reduction that have been discussed in the industry, the reductions that you have heard about, that manufacturers have talked about, but also, several analysts have indicated those as well. And of course, the near-term outlook has also, as we said, continued to weaken through the course of our FQ1 time frame and even since our FQ2 has started, those demand weakening trends have continued as well. So I think that this is the information that is out there, is what we're using, but we can only talk about ourselves and we can -- we certainly have taken here decisive actions in terms of managing our output growth in line with our demand expectations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Christopher Rakers, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, just thinking about your product portfolio, particularly around the enterprise SSD market, I'm curious, it sounds like possibly you're seeing maybe even a quicker ramp towards NVMe than what you previously have seen. I mean, is there a way to kind of quantify how much of maybe the enterprise SSD market is kind of moving away from you until you get your products into the market in the latter part of this calendar year -- or calendar year '19?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly, as we have been speaking for a while, the transition from SATA to NVMe is taking place at a fast pace in enterprise, as well as in cloud applications. And we have been focused on developing our own products. And that's why we have said that in calendar year -- our fiscal year 2019, as we bring out our new NVMe products to the market, our 2019 calendar year ends up being more a year of transition for us. But there is no question that the market certainly is moving from SATA to NVMe applications across-the-board. And we have just introduced some of our early NVMe products for consumer SSDs, and I talked about how we have introduced NVMe product for automotive applications as well. And during the course of calendar 2019, we'll first be bringing out client NVMe products to the market, and then later in the year, we'll bring enterprise and cloud NVMe SSDs. And that's why we look at calendar year 2020 will be the one time frame when we start gaining share again in our SSDs -- SSD market.

And our next question will come from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Romit Jitendra Shah, Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst of Semiconductors [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sanjay, I heard you indicate that you expect above average cost declines, but I guess my question is, aren't the actions that you've announced today probably more of a hit to cost per bit in 2020 versus 2019? How do we think about that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think what we have shown you today is that we are able to take decisive actions and we are able to take them fast. I mean, just remember that FQ4 was a record year for the company. And FQ1 is when we first saw signs of inventory adjustment. During the course of FQ1, we have been able to react in terms of cutting down our CapEx, as well as manage our output growth. So point is, we can react fast to the changes that are needed in the marketplace, and we remain, this is something we review very, very closely on an ongoing basis, very focused on making sure that we are maximizing the long-term profitability and long-term growth opportunity for Micron. So this is something that in terms of cost, we feel very good about our position for 2019 and beyond -- going beyond that. We of course continue to make very good progress on our technology nodes. As I discussed with you, our technology on 1Z is progressing well. We feel good about that roadmap and continue to make good progress on our NAND roadmap as well. And that will all position us well for 2019 as well as for 2020 time frame. And I just want to point out that our focus also is on shifting our portfolio to high-value solutions, and those will also strengthen our profitability profile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Romit Jitendra Shah, Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst of Semiconductors [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess as my follow-up, on CapEx, I mean, you are cutting your forecast for the year, but CapEx is still up on a year-on-year basis. I'm curious, if this downturn ends up being longer than any of us sort of anticipate, is there leverage to reduce CapEx even further from current levels?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I will just touch on CapEx, on your previous question on cost, I also wanted to point out that on the cost side, we are making tremendous progress on the back-end assembly and test cost reductions, as well as managing, transforming our supply chain operations, which will give us significant cost benefits as well. So, all in all, 2019 and beyond feel very good about our technology roadmap, manufacturing roadmap capability, as well as overall cost capabilities. In terms of, on the CapEx side, just keep in mind that we have said that with the adjustments that we just have made, over wafer equipment CapEx actually is coming down in fiscal year '19 versus fiscal year '18. And as we've discussed before, Micron over the last few years, have significantly underinvested in clean room shell CapEx in the facilities and the buildings that are needed to really implement ongoing future technology transitions and a big part of our CapEx, as we have shared with you the past, actually is going towards buildings and facilities, clean room that will be needed for future technology transitions as well. All of that CapEx does not contribute to bit growth. And similarly, we a have significant increase in our CapEx in fiscal year '19 over fiscal year '18 on back-end test and assembly operations as well. And that is, again, intended to reduce costs, and not -- it doesn't go towards any bit growth. And we have flexibility, as we have shown already, in terms of managing CapEx. We'll continue to look at this carefully. And if any factors require us to change our CapEx outlook again, we will absolutely address it in a timely and prudent fashion. We always continue to evaluate market environment, as well as our own status of technology, transitions, production requirements, and we are making real-time adjustments as needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Romit Jitendra Shah, Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst of Semiconductors [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I mean, it seems like the actions you guys are taking are very prudent, but I -- the part that's confusing for me is, if you're slowing your process migration, then there should be some impact to cost per bit. And I'm just, I guess I'm just not quite, I just don't quite understand what that impact is?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Again, in terms of cost per bit, there are a lot of details that have to be looked at. We're not going to get into all of those details here. Key message here is that we are bringing our production output in line with our demand expectations. Second, we feel very good about our technology position and our cost position, and we'll continue to do very well in this regard. Cost position, of course, includes wafer level, die cost position, but also includes the benefits of assembly and test cost improvements that we are making; and third, is we absolutely stay focused on our high-value solutions strategy, and we're executing well in this area. We talked about how in mobile, even in a market environment of significant NAND oversupply, we actually have delivered strong gains in our mobile high-value solutions portfolio as well.

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the Whole Foods integration? How you see that contributing to the bottom line over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the strong AWS results, but unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at the rate it was in the past. Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, thanks, Justin. This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. There's some disclosure around additions to unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement. So when you look at that, for the 3 months ended, you'll see that up around 34%, 35% versus the same time last year.
And historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is big and leading contributor to that is Prime memberships. The example is a customer signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that amortize over the 12 month period. That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other one area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services, features like reserved instances where those customers can pay for services upfront, in some cases and receive discounts over a multiyear period. What we're seeing and more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece, we launched month-to-month Prime last year, and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go. So there's less that's deferred. So, that's I think one of a number of factors. There's obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces that I just mentioned. But we've seen monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program. So that's part of what you're seeing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And your question about Whole Foods, yes, we're really excited to have them as part of the team now after the acquisition in late August. What you see in the financial results for this quarter is a -- it's shown actually in the new physical stores, revenue component $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating income. And that's where you'll be seeing Whole Foods revenue showing up. In addition, that is -- that class of revenue, physical store's revenue is going to be where we are going to book any sales that where a customer physically select an item in a store. So it also -- it does include our Amazon Books. If you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores. Launching the private-label -- Whole Foods private-label products on Amazon, we've got technical work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores. So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're real excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guess I'll ask 2 as well. The first one is, that was a bit of a usual upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. Is there -- what would you -- what's most surprised you in the quarter? You've been pretty consistent to how you reported versus your guide. So something unusual happened or somewhat unusual happen? What would you attribute that to?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, we talked about that on the last call, but it really carried into the quarter. We had a record day for sign-ups for free trials for Prime and Prime Day globally. Had a very strong Prime Day in particular internationally. So it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I would point mostly to those factors. There's also very strong quarter for AWS, revenue growth was the same as Q2 and now we're at an $18 billion run rate. Whereas last quarter, when I had this call, we were at $16 billion. So very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And then briefly on the international retail, that growth also by itself was intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets geographic markets, you would call out there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the impact of Souq, obviously this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally and it carried through the quarter. So it's -- but generally, I would point to the increase selection, a lot of the building blocks we've been working on. All the Prime benefits, advancement and free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits that drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but stronger than -- it was stronger than probably I anticipated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have 2. Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering, could you talk about 1 or 2 of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just a strategic opportunity, as you see, of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business? And the second one on the subscriptions revenue, you accelerated to 59%, could you just talk about which countries or which regions are driving that? And maybe talk a little bit about the growth or the cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date and -- what I could tell you is, I've been in meetings with John Mackey and his team and they're very like-minded with us, customer-obsessed, ready to work together to continue their mission then expand on their offerings that we can offer customers. The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling products on -- their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now and Whole Foods, as we can explore different ways to serve the customer. So that's kind of the earlier report on Whole Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after the summer of closing the deal. On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had essentially 59% growth, you said, 600 basis points higher than Q2. In this line item is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services from digital music, digital video, audio books, eBooks. So there's some moving parts in there. The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships. And as I said, we had a great -- the largest new Prime -- new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction. It's an attractive option for a lot of people. And again, on this -- on the other subscription services, music especially, it works just so well with our Echo device that we're seeing a lot of growth in that area as we increase the number of Echo devices and customers using the Echo devices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the comment in the release on seasonal workers, that looks roughly flat year-on-year. I wanted to know if you could understand a little bit more about the trajectory around the workers needed to fulfill seasonal holiday demand and what that might also mean for automation or efficiency benefits you're getting inside your fulfillment centers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Eric. This is Dave. I think we put out a release saying earlier this quarter talking about 120,000 operations folks to bring into our fulfillment centers this year. So we're continuing to hire and hire across a number of locations. We talked earlier this year about expecting to see a greater than -- roughly greater than 30% square footage growth in an operations, so we're certainly hiring to support that. More of these facilities do have Amazon Robotics and certainly that helps with the efficiencies there, but it requires tremendous effort from a number of our folks as well. And so we'll continue to hire there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While we're on this subject of headcount. Headcount grew 77% year-over-year in the quarter. That includes the impact of the Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions. Without those -- without that headcount, the base Amazon grew 47%, which is still up from 42% in Q2. So a lot of the additional pickup in Q3 was tied to our ramp for the holidays. We continue to hire a lot of software engineers. We continue to hire a lot of sales reps, and it's tied directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian, I was hoping you could help us understand how at this point you're prioritizing expansion into new product categories. In particular, there's a lot of talk now about potentially using Whole Foods stores for physical pharmacy presence and also that you've perhaps got an approvals across multiple states in that category. Can you just help us understand the approach in general to new categories and pharmacy, in particular?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I can't confirm or deny any of the rumors related to pharmacy or anything else. I will say we do see a lot of opportunity with Whole Foods. As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Lockers at the Amazon -- excuse me, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. So there'll be a lot of integration, a lot of touch points and a lot of working together as we go forward. And we think we'll also be developing new store formats and everything else just as we've talked about in the past with before Whole Foods, amazon Bookstores, Amazon Go and the opportunity that technology presents. We have campus -- on-campus bookstores. So we're experimenting with a lot of formats. I think that Whole Foods really gives us a vast head start on that and a great base and a great team to work with who has a lot of history, and a lot of -- they probably have 10 to 20 years of learnings that we don't have and wouldn't have. So we're really excited about that. And I think working together will bring our different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Alan May, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The other category which includes advertising accelerated 58% in the quarter. I think the common view there is that's a fairly high-margin business, certainly higher than corporate average. Is there any reason why that isn't the right assumption to make? Essentially what impact is the growth in the ad business having on the company's overall profitability? And in terms of the increased losses in the international retail segment of the business, can you provide some color around how much of that's being driven by Amazon launching into new markets, which I know you continue to do, versus investing more heavily in existing markets?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Let me start with the revenue. So you're right. Other revenue grew 58% in the quarter, and that includes advertising services and other things such as our cobranded credit card agreements. Advertising revenue continues to grow very quickly, and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there. But I would say generally, we're very pleased with the advertising business. Our goal here is to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping and selection choices. We'll also provide in giving them targeted recommendations. So making it helpful for customers rather than intrusive. And then we believe that by creating that (inaudible) and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers. So it's an important part of the flywheel and the -- so it's -- the traffic and the customers, especially the Prime customers that come to the site, are really the ones that we can use to help them select items and use advertising to help make their decisions more informed when they're picking products.
On the international, yes, I can't split it, the effects. But I'll tell you again, it is international expansion in -- primarily in India where we're continuing to add benefits, and we launched Prime there a year ago, if you remember, and we've had more Prime members joined in India than in any other country in the first 12 months. We have free shipping on 10 million items there, and we're continuing to add benefits: Prime Video, Amazon Family, we've had a first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music. Amazon business is also expanding in India. So a lot of positive momentum and investment going on in India. Very pleased with that. We also recently announced Echo and Alexa are available in India. So that -- that should be well received by the Indian consumer base. But excluding India and Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the continued growth in the other countries that we've been in for a while, continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh. In Video, we launched -if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in 200 -- over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers. So becoming more engaged, and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing free shipping offers and also speed of shipping offers. So there's a lot of -- a lot of different influences there. You saw the growth rate. It's, we believe, it's resonating with customers. So we will continue to invest and think that we have a good path forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Adam Sandler, Barclays PLC, Research Division - MD of the Americas Equity Research and Senior Internet Analyst [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two questions. There's been some news flow recently about Brazil expansion. Can you just talk about how Brazil compares to maybe some of the other international markets that you're investing in? What level of investment should we expect in Brazil maybe relative to like in Australia or in India? And then the follow-up on the Whole Foods. So do you feel like the store footprint at 460-odd stores is adequate? Or any color on plans to expand either the Whole Foods store footprint or the Amazon bookstores or those other ones you mentioned?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Ross. Thanks for the question. This is Dave. On Brazil, just briefly, yes, we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. It's a third-party marketplace offering. You may recall we've been in Brazil for a number of years now, initially launched with really a Kindle and eBooks offering without the sort of physical categories and more recently added physical books again, a third-party marketplace offering. So I think we're excited about the electronics that are getting out there. There's a wide variety of products included in that category: Smartphones, tablets, cameras, TVs, what have you. So I think, really excited to get that technology out there for Brazilians. And I think beyond that, really just focus on those categories and growing selection there, but I can't speculate on what we might do in the future there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And on Whole Foods, yes, I believe the total is 465 stores or thereabouts. And we have 12 bookstores now. We are adding a few more in the near future in California, Washington D.C. and Austin. So yes, you will see more expansion from us. We're not ready to announce any, what that will look like, and we're working with the Whole Foods team on what maybe what they will -- how many more stores we might have in that area. But still early. So, those plans will develop over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath P. Terry, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I understand you can't comment on rumors one way or the other, but curious as you think about categories like health care and obviously you guys are already in health care to some degree through Amazon Business, can you give us a bit of a status update on what you do have out there now? And particularly how the company and management thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time? How you would approach that versus a standard category that you might go into? Or maybe again, I know you can't comment on rumors, how you have approached to that in the past or in other market? And then to the extent that we are thinking about AWS growth in the fourth quarter, you guys are lapping the price cuts from last year and obviously have about an 800 basis point easier comp Q3 to Q4, taking those 2 things into consideration, how should we think about AWS growth through the end of the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Heath, this is Dave. I'll take that first question in relation to health care. I think where you're seeing us do some work on that, I think is in the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now. And so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they're hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies. I mean there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that. And so I think what you're seeing us do is really focus on services that meet those businesses, multiuser accounts, improving approval workflow tools, and just more recently, we introduced Amazon Business for Business Prime shipping, which we think will be a great way for our businesses use multiuser -- Business customers that have multiuser accounts, and that's in the U.S. and in Germany. So I think it's part of that offering, and we really have to see how that evolves. And the other side, too, is certainly health care is one of many sectors as part of Amazon Web Services that are important customers that we're focusing on and building tools for. So probably nothing specific to call out on that one, but that's a lot of what you're seeing from us today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, on AWS, we don't provide segment level estimates, but we did consider in our guidance the impact of the price cuts last year. You're right, we had a number of price cuts on (inaudible) time to -- about around December 1 of last year that certainly had an impact on Q4 of last year. But again, price cuts and not only price cuts, but new products that have lower average costs and can cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business all the time in AWS. So we're looking forward to a strong Q4 and re:Invent is in December, so that's -- the end of November, early December, so that is also an exciting time of year for the AWS business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott W. Devitt, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had 2, please. The first, Prime Now, Fresh Prime Pantry and Whole Foods, they're all distinct offerings, but it does seem like there's natural overlap with the potential to be further connected. And I was just wondering if you could just speak to how we should think about those 4 as distinct product offerings in the future versus being more integrated and possibly even, in some cases, eliminated to remove overlap from a customer experience standpoint? And then secondly, given the recent management changes in video, Brian, I was just wondering if you could speak to any strategic shifts in Video or changes in the pace of content portfolio build in coming years?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, let me start with Video, and I just want to be clear, we are going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018. And why are we going to do that? It's because the Video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers. They continue to -- it continues to drive better conversion of free trials, higher membership renewal rates for existing subscribers and higher overall engagement. We're seeing engagement go up year after year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits. We also know Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon. And we have a lot of data. We're -- that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the 2 together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make midcourse corrections. So we always do that, the -- we're always changing the emphasis and looking for those more impactful shows, more shows that resonate better with our customer base and things they want to see. And -- so that will always be an important part of our Prime offer, and we'll continue to use the data that we have to make better and better decisions about where to invest our dollars in Prime Video. So we're very -- we remain very bullish on the Video business, and we're looking forward to a lot of interesting new projects back end of this year and also lined up into next year. On the -- sorry, the second comment was, the overlap. Yes, so Whole Foods, I think I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but specifically, Prime Now, and also, AmazonFresh. And we're going to work to see how we expand those offerings, and in some cases, combine them. We're not sure how it will play out, but we're going to cooperate across those different customer touch points and trying to make them better for customers. We know customers are going to buy just like in the physical world, sometimes you go to a convenience store, sometimes you go to a supermarket, sometimes you go to a superstore. Sometimes you need things within an hour, sometimes you can wait days for shipment. So there's no one paradigm for all customer engagement, and we're looking for the ones that resonate best with customers, and we're going to continue to work on those.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason Stuart Helfstein, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Internet Analyst [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll actually ask 2 if I can. Just any way you can comment on the increase in Whole Foods traffic after the close? And then second, talk about your desire to have an ad-supported business on Fire TV or through Prime Video?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think I'll start on traffic. So we're not disclosing traffic figures. Whole Foods will be issuing a final 10-K at the end of the -- early next month, so you'll see a better perspective on the entire quarter. The quarter -- the 4-week period that you see running through the Amazon P&L this quarter is pretty hard to draw conclusions on other than revenue at this point. But Dave, do you have more on the...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Jason, this is Dave. On the ad-supported question, I think what you've seen to date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer as a Prime Video member and watching content, we view that as you paid into that service and able to watch those shows ad-free. There may be instances where you're viewing a first episode and there's an ad leading into that if it's the first free episode, but generally like to have that as customers have paid into that program and they'll be able to enjoy that without interruption.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our final question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ronald Victor Josey, JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just wanted to ask about delivery, in just over the last several months, we've seen a lot of announcements in products around delivery options between Lockers, testing the Kohl's partnership, Whole Foods, obviously, Amazon Key came out recently. I just wanted to better understand this investment. Is this a result of -- or the thesis that more options could drive, obviously, more sales on the flip side? Do you think you're losing some sales by not having those options?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Probably a little of both. We think that, especially as we get into more and more Amazon Logistics deliveries, we're going to experiment with different ways to deliver things that make it easier on consumers, things that cut down on potential theft on doorsteps, but really it's mostly about increasing convenience for them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I think that's right, in terms of overall investments there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And the other investments, obviously, are maybe the bigger-ish things are like planes and transportation capacity in general. And there our philosophy is, again, we're going to watch out for our customers, we're going to build capacity that gives them great service 12 months a year but particularly at holidays, by investing in those transportation options, we do so at same costs or cost parity, I would say, at the very minimum, but it also allows us to do interesting things like extend cutoff times for customers, enable Sunday delivery, enable better weekend delivery. So we're seeing a lot of benefits, just the ability to stretch the order cut off from what once was 3 p.m. in the afternoon to midnight, has huge benefits both for the customer and also for Amazon. It results in incremental sales, it also builds that trust that when you need something, Amazon's going to be there for you. And I need to remind you that the Thursday Night Football game will start in 2 hours and 20 minutes so.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On that, thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd like to focus on the North American retail operating margins. That 4.5% was the highest, I think, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the full quarter of the Whole Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and how sustainable is it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company. I'll note where the North America elements are strongest. So for the quarter, we came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26 -- 36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses are busy. So it was very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off a similar increase in 2016. So amid all these opening of new buildings, many of them late in the year, the ops team did a fantastic job. Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offerings more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America. Although not in the North America segment, I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say it was the -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also a very clean operational performance. Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years. And this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian, I was hoping you could talk about how you're thinking about your primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context of '17. Are there things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also how you would think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. I -- we'll be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're in a $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- excuse me, $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with the -- both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response. We'll continue geographic expansion and continuing to, again, build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits we continue to expand globally. Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us, both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales, we had very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner -- partners we work with. Skills there, we've increased rapidly. We're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000-plus smart home devices from 1,200 unique brands. So the -- the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of -- excuse me, Alexa with our devices. Obviously, Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets. And we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year. Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things I would point to. And that is an area, again, where we'll continue to invest heavily and as we say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is -- fulfillment capacity, especially to fuel the strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate, we expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call, we do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the video content, their use of it on devices. And we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'll be release -- yes, I'll incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Adam Sandler, Barclays PLC, Research Division - MD of the Americas Equity Research and Senior Internet Analyst [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey guys, just 2 questions. AWS reaccelerated again this quarter. Can you just give us some color on what were the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now as -- is that -- what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact of greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods. So yes, we consider that a very strong quarter, down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently. That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. We're now over 100 million items in the U.S. So yes, shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model. And we, at the same time, look to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area. AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end. So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth. Usage growth continues to be strong, growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate and customers continue to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost there -- excuse me, a price decrease last year, but very happy with the performance in -- of the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Alan May, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian, if you look back historically, your Q1 operating income guidance is typically about $300 million, $400 million lower than your Q4. Obviously, it's significantly greater than that this quarter. Maybe if you could shed a little light on why that is so and what are some of the key drivers there. And AWS and cloud pricing appears to have been more subtle in recent quarters. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and why that has been the case at least compared to trends from back in '14, '15 and previously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Let me start with guidance. So yes, the operating income guidance is $300 million to $1 billion. Operating income last year was $1 billion. Q1 is generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4, obviously, but a lot of the costs remain from the year-over-year buildup in costs, particularly in the fulfillment network. So it's generally a headwind every Q1. It's -- given the 30%-plus growth in square footage last year that we've built, that's one major headwind from Q4 to Q1. But we also continue to invest, particularly in Alexa and our device area. As I mentioned in a number of comments earlier, we're very happy with the results, the customer adoption, the device sales that we're seeing and the general customer acceptance there. So we will continue to invest there. Those are probably the 2 largest factors in Q1, I would say.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. This is Dave. Just on the second piece on just pricing. I think in the pricing environment, I mean, nothing really to call out there. I guess, just a reminder on our pricing philosophy for AWS. Periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business. We reduced prices more than 60 times with AWS since launching. So really, our kind of goal and philosophy here is to drive efficiencies in our ops and pass those savings on to customers. And some of that's through, again, with the more than 60 price reductions, but also finding through new service and feature launches better options for a customer that present -- customers to present more efficient features for them to be able to run their businesses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniel Salmon, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Media and Internet Analyst [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, Brian, any comments on the impact of ASC 606 accounting changes on your first quarter guidance here? And then just second on the advertising business, in particular, the ads that we see in the search results on the site, the headline search ad, sponsored product ads, do you aim for a certain particular ad load across the entire platform? Do you look at sort of tailoring it based on user's activity, maybe a combination of both? Would just be interested in your thoughts on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. This is Dave. I'll take the first part of that question just around the new revenue recognition standard. We did adopt the new standard on January 1 of this year, 2018. And you'll see that reflected in our financials for the first quarter coming up. There -- it touches on a number of different parts of our business in terms of how we recognize revenue. In terms of in the aggregate and the impact to our expectations for the revenue guidance for the first quarter, it's not material. There's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impacted with this. But again, not material in the aggregate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And on advertising, I would say our strategy is to make the customer experience additive by the ad process. We want customers to be able to see new brands and have easier time discovering products that they're looking for. For brands, we think the value proposition is that we can find ways for them, especially emerging brands, to reach new customers. So we're working with advertisers of all types and sizes to help them reach our customer base and the goal of driving brand awareness, discovery and better purchase decisions by the customer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think I have 2 questions. First, Whole Foods, you've got over a quarter under your belt. How's it going versus your expectations? And what can Amazon really bring now that you've been there for a while, how you're thinking about that? And then secondly, international decelerated a little bit this quarter, just wondering if there was any country to call out or anything going on there. And we know that you spent about $3 billion international investment, I guess, last year. Where do you think the high-water mark is on that? So just maybe a little bit more color on your international business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Let me start with the Whole Foods question. We're continuing to be very excited about the opportunities we have to innovate with the Whole Foods and Amazon teams together in our physical stores. It states in our supplemental disclosure that physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. So -- so far, our focus has been on continuing to lower prices even beyond the initial ones that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website. And the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program. And we expect to have more on that later in the year. We've also added Lockers and much more to come. So we're very happy with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin. Also, I will mention that we did see a small operating income/loss for the quarter from Whole Foods. At the time of the acquisition, we had stepped up the fair market value of certain assets on the balance sheet. This is going to increase the amortization. It's a noncash charge, but it will increase the amortization over the useful life. And a lot of that is forward front-loaded, so we'll see higher amortization in the first few years and then it reverses later. So excluding these noncash expense items, Whole Foods had a positive operating income in Q4, but you'll see in the 10-K that the operating income, including the charges, was slightly negative in Q4. International growth, your comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q4 -- 3, if that was your point. 28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite a bit by Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of locales. Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting to gain more and more traction there. So that is probably more of a help to Q3 than a discussion of any weakness in Q4. So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in international countries as well. And also in that number is India. And India continues to be a good story for us. We feel that it's had a lot of growth in the past year. In fact, more Prime members joined India's Prime program in the first year than we've seen in any other country in the history of the world, our world. So the selection is also increasing Prime eligible selection is up over 25 million items, launching video there and also continuing to add other Prime benefits such as Prime Music will be coming soon. Amazon Family is there. As I said, Prime Video, and we had our first Prime Day in India. So that's a little bit on international growth.

Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have 2. The first one, in the press release, you talk about the strength of the Prime member growth in 2017. Could you talk a little bit about to the -- what you're seeing in growth in Prime subscribers in the United States at this point? And are you still seeing a similar tick up in consumer spending as they come into Prime as you have in the past? And the second one, Brian, to go back to an earlier question on areas of investment this year, you didn't talk a whole lot about kind of new categories to expand into beyond the old retail business. Curious to hear about the investment needed to go into logistics, health care and kind of new areas you haven't really cracked into as hard yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. This is Dave. Thanks for the question, Brian. Just on the first piece, in terms of just Prime membership and Prime behavior, we continue to see that we're seeing sign-ups for memberships at a strong clip. When we look at the year-over-year growth in paid Prime members on a global basis, it's been consistent in Q4 year-over-year, similar growth rates year-over-year to what we've seen in some of the earlier quarters of this year. So that's, of course, a mix of strength in the U.S. and also strength in some of the newer markets that we've launched or introduced the Prime program in. We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the program, their purchasing patterns change and they do spend more as they move into the program. And of course, our focus is -- continues to be on adding some of the features around Prime that Brian's been talking about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like Fulfillment by Amazon, which is -- continues to be a fast grower for us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. And on new businesses or expansion of categories, as you discussed, I would not talk to anything that's not been publicly announced, but on some of the ones you mentioned, they are underway and are continuing. I would say on logistics, we will continue to build our logistics capability both -- and that will be all the way, too. And delivery, we've been able to increase service levels in many cases by delivering it ourselves. And although we have a strong partner network here, we will always be able to leverage our strength and our knowledge about where shipments are going, both within our network and to final customers that will create opportunities for us there as we increase or better the customer experience as well. We continue -- I would say on the category side, the biggest effort will continue to be on groceries and consumables with the Whole Foods acquisition. And again, we continue to look at our whole offering of AmazonFresh, Prime Now, Whole Foods, how can they work together to create better and better offerings for our customer base. And to a lesser extent, versus grocery, I would say, we continue to build our business, B2B businesses, and very happy with the initial performance there with a number of the companies and universities that we've been working with and their initial results.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Andrew Mushkin, Wolfe Research, LLC - MD and Senior Retail & Staples Analyst [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I want to go back to -- and I think you said one of the big focuses of the year is going to be on the consumables, Now, Fresh, Whole Foods. There's been a lot of press on the Whole Foods front, the out-of-stock issue and then clearly in the Now as we've been testing it and Fresh has the same issue. So I was wondering if you guys could talk about what the company plans to do. I mean, there is obviously the reputational risk that could come from that to kind of correct some of these issues and kind of what the view of the company is on the out-of-stock issues, not just at Whole Foods, but just generally across the consumables business in Fresh and Now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. I'm not -- let me just back it to a more general statement. I'd say, Whole Foods is not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers. We made no changes post the acquisition that would have impacted anything related to in-stock, except perhaps the fact that price decreases have brought up demand and there's an amount of rebalancing related to that. So I think the out-of-stock issues that may be getting press are tied more to the increased demand that we're seeing and also selective weather-related restocking issues. But stepping beyond any short-term issues, the commitment is -- remains to have healthy, high-quality selection in stock for products. That's what the Whole Foods team has committed to. That's what the Amazon team, with them, is committed to. And also across any delivery channel that we have, AmazonFresh, Prime Now or Whole Foods. So where there's issues, they'll be corrected. Where there's areas we can improve our selection and delivery for customers, we'll do so. But it'll be something that we're working on. So the immediacy, the perishability are all challenges everyone has in this area, but we're confident that we will have a good service and continue to delight customers.

Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Youssef Houssaini Squali, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've seen that the number of private-label products on the site has increased pretty dramatically over the last 12, 18 months. Can you speak to your private-label strategy in general? How big is that segment today? How big can it become? And just broadly speaking, how are the margins in that segment versus comparable third-party products?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Thanks for the question. This is Dave. I think broadly, when I look at our strategy, it's focused on, number one, providing a broad selection for customers across a number of categories so that they can find and buy exactly what they're looking for. When you look at private brands, it's very much meant to supplement that great selection. And we look for ways to be able to find private-label items that have a high caliber of quality, but also can bring that selection and that convenience for customers and really supplement what vendors and sellers are already providing to customers in many cases. We've not broken out kind of how significant or how large that is. I think for a lot of these initiatives, when you look across categories that we offer, many of them are still earlier stage and have been around even from kind of infancy for shorter period of time, a year, a couple of years in some cases. Amazon Fashion is one area where you're seeing us offer a number of private apparel brands. Some of the more sort of popular lines with customers have been things like Goodthreads, Amazon Essentials, which is men's and women's basics. Consumables is, of course, another big area where we have the benefit of working with some of the Whole Foods private label, but also doing some of our other Amazon brands, things like Happy Belly and Wickedly Prime and others so. I think we'll continue to iterate on those and try to find different areas. And certainly, there's other verticals that I didn't mention there that we're interested in continuing to kind of learn from customers what they want and what they're looking for there. And so we'll keep adding selection.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Wells Fargo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kenneth Michael Sena, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Internet Equity Research & Senior Analyst [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe if you could just remind us of the thinking that -- behind keeping AWS and retail under one corporate structure. And does it make sense given the scale of where AWS is right now? And then -- and I'm sorry I have a little bit of an echo, I don't know why, but -- and we're hearing from marketers just how important Amazon is to their media strategy. So I don't know if you could just maybe talk about that a little bit more broadly in terms of the approach and your philosophy to that business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. We see a lot of value in all of our businesses. And AWS is a key component as is the physical consumer business. The -- what I'll point out is the management team is a common management team. The consumer business, if you will, is, if not the biggest, one of the largest customers of AWS. So we see a lot of commonality there where we as -- depending on position in the company. On the consumer side, the use of AWS has driven great infrastructure efficiencies, just like other companies see when they use AWS, turning fixed cost into variable cost and pooling resources and not having a lot of trapped capacity throughout the company and taking advantage of all the new services and features. So as a internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS. And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services. So it's a good combination for a lot of reasons, and we see no reason to change the structure that we have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. And sorry, Ken, your second question was?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kenneth Michael Sena, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD, Head of Internet Equity Research & Senior Analyst [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. The second question was just on the advertising side. And just -- we're just hearing so much more how important Amazon is to broader media budgets. And so just hoping to get maybe a little bit more color just on your approach to the business right now, some of the drivers behind the recent success and just maybe just more of a sort of, as you look out over the next few years, kind of how important do you see this business becoming in the grand scheme of things?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. I mean, I think right now, we're really just focused on finding ways to work with those companies, whether it's vendors or sellers that are coming to us and offer them a great experience on the website and an ability to be able to reach customers. So I think there's more to come on that side. As we said, we're definitely seeing some strong growth in our advertising revenue as part of the other revenue line item. And I think we're going to keep building more new tools based on what we're learning from our customers there to better serve in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think we're also part of the key lean in from a lot of brands and agencies into the e-commerce marketing space. So whether it's our site alongside search or social marketing, it's really helping them engage customers on a high, efficient -- highly efficient manner.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, - [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Intel Corporation Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Trey Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trey Campbell, Intel Corporation - Head of IR [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan; and our CFO, George Davis. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Trey, and thank you all for joining our call. We had an outstanding Q1 in the midst of incredibly challenging circumstances. We generated $19.8 billion in revenue, expanded operating margin by 10 points and delivered $1.45 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $800 million on the top line and $0.15 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and now represent approximately 51% of the company's revenue, and our PC-centric business grew 14%.
We'll talk about business trends later, but first, I want to thank and commend all the Intel employees and supply chain partners who have helped keep our business operating during this unprecedented challenge. I want to give a special praise to those in our factories and labs and other on-site personnel who have role modeled the values of our company every day and every shift. I am so incredibly proud of your effort and commitment. I also want to thank the rest of our employees who are largely working remotely to help support the social distancing requirements of those that need to work from our sites. Ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce has and will continue to be our #1 priority. That's why we are investing more than $100 million in additional benefits to aid and support employees, including a special recognition award for employees that have been working on site.
Intel's purpose is to create world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth. Never before has our delivery of that purpose been more essential. Intel technology runs 95% of the world's Internet communication and government digital infrastructure. And in a world where many of us are working remotely and socially distancing, the PCs and networking technologies delivered by Intel and our customers are providing a unifying fabric that's bringing us closer together, helping those directly struggling with the virus or caring for those who are enabling remote classrooms so that our children can continue to learn and connecting governments and businesses so they can operate and deliver goods and services.
Around the world, Intel platforms that support telemedicines have also taken on greater importance since the outbreak of COVID-19 as hospitals and health care workers scale to meet the increasing demand for care. Our products and capabilities are also delivering vital computing power for medical research, robotics for assisted patient care and artificial intelligence and data analytics for public health. We recognize that our local and global communities need us to continue delivering technology to help overcome this COVID-19 challenge, and we're fully focused on that task. Our world-class safety standards have allowed our factories to continue to operate safely on a relatively normal basis with greater than 90% on-time delivery. We only allow employees in our factories who are essential to the factories' operations. By design, our clean rooms and factories are among the cleanest places in the world.
While most of our construction projects have remained operational, we have had to temporarily pause a few projects due to local government restrictions at a small number of our sites. We will restart those projects in due course, and we expect these interruptions to have minimal impact on our ramp and no impact on our process technology transition time line.
We also realized that solving the enormous challenge of COVID-19 requires catalyzing the world's innovation in new ways. Intel is committed to accelerating access to technology that can combat the current pandemic and enable new technology and scientific discovery to better prepare society for future crisis. To that end, we've pledged $50 million in a global pandemic response technology initiative to combat the coronavirus through improved access to technology at the point of patient care, to speed scientific research and to ensure access to online learning for students and teachers. We are also granting free access to our IP to all COVID-19 researchers and scientists.
At the same time, we also know that our communities need help right now. Between Intel and our foundation, we are providing $10 million towards coronavirus relief in the communities where we have significant presence. This will aid community organizations focused on food security, shelter, medical equipment and small business support. We also want to assist our communities' critically important health care workers in any way possible, so we have committed more than 1 million items of personal protective equipment. We have already started delivering masks, gloves, face shields and other gear that we've sourced from our supply chain and inventory on hand to local health authorities who are best positioned to determine the areas of greatest need. Beyond Intel's donations, our employees inspire us every day with the many ways they are applying their skills, generous spirit and technical innovation to help people and communities across the globe persevere through this crisis.
George will give more detail on what we're seeing and expect in the business. But first, I want to reiterate our strategy and priorities. Even as COVID-19 drives significant disruptions across the globe, our long-term strategy, to deliver the world's best semiconductors for an increasingly data-centric world, is unchanged. And the environment is uncertain, but our priorities are unwavering. We are focused on accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital.
Over the last several years, we've transformed the company and are now positioned to grow our share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We live in a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals and our factories. Additionally, we have redefined Intel Inside to include much more than the CPU as we've expanded our silicon offering to include ASICS, FPGAS, GPUs and Optane, among other capabilities. Our opportunity set is more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so that we can have a larger impact on our customers' success. And our quarterly results demonstrate the benefits of that diversity. Nowhere is growth accelerating more than in our cloud and networking businesses where we are helping our customers transform the way they move, store and process data.
Through this crisis, the world's cloud and network infrastructure has delivered massive scaling to support vital workloads for businesses and consumers. Cloud-delivered applications seen as conveniences a quarter ago, such as online shopping and video collaboration, have now become indispensable. We scaled our cloud and communication service provider businesses by 53% and 33% year-over-year, respectively, to help our customers meet these growing needs. These 2 segments now drive 70% of our data center segment revenue.
New usage and market needs are also pushing compute resources closer to the data source or point-of-service delivery, giving rise to an increasingly intelligent edge. Our edge business delivers a wide range of platforms, including some innovative solutions that are helping the medical community tackle COVID-19. One example is Medical Informatics' Sickbay platform. Powered by Intel technology, this solution can turn beds into virtual ICU beds in minutes, helping protect critical health care workers while expanding their care capacity significantly. Houston Methodist Hospital deployed Sickbay for its virtual ICU and was able to leverage it within 1 day to support remote monitoring of its COVID-19 patients without risking exposure to care providers. We are also partnering closely with Medtronic and Dyson as they use Intel technologies to deliver much needed ventilators. We also continue to demonstrate significant progress in ADAS and autonomous driving. While auto vehicle production is largely stalled, Mobileye delivered another proof point, demonstrating its leadership position with a landmark first-ever design win with a major Asian OEM.
Finally, we see AI as a significant growth opportunity and are embedding AI capability into everything we make. AI has the power to reimagine how we solve problems across industries, including cutting-edge health care diagnostics, for example, in China, Intel teams with Lenovo and BGI Genomics to accelerate the analysis of genomic characteristics of COVID-19. Our combined work will further advance the capabilities of BGI sequencing tools to help scientists investigate transmission patterns of the virus and create better diagnostic methods. And in India, we are working with government labs, academia and industry to achieve faster and cheaper testing, accelerate drug discovery through virus genome sequencing and help architect a pandemic response platform.
We acquired Habana in the fourth quarter of last year to strengthen our AI portfolio and accelerate our efforts in a nascent, fast-growing AI silicon market that we expect will grow to $25 billion by 2024. This quarter, we have largely completed the integration. We consolidated product road maps, aligned software resources and are executing to our deal thesis. We are also now sampling Habana's first deep learning training processor to large CSPs.
I'll now take a few minutes to discuss how we're executing to our supply and road map objectives. Shortly after our January call, we started to see the impact of COVID-19 in China, forcing many of our ODM partners to extend Chinese New Year factory shutdowns. ODM partners have now returned to work, and production is increasing every week. As I mentioned earlier, our factories remain operational. And in Q1, we are able to mitigate most of the COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions and fulfill all of our customers' committed client CPU orders as expected. We remain on track to add sufficient wafer capacity this year so that we meet market demand and restore our PC unit inventory to more normal levels. Near-term PC demand has increased due to work from home and online learning, but the second half demand picture is more uncertain. We continue to assess how COVID-19 impacts to the economy will offset the immediate catalysts for more remote work and will balance wafer start plans accordingly.
We have made strong progress on a wave of 10-nanometer-based product introductions this year. This quarter, we announced the new Intel Atom P5900 SoC, Snow Ridge, a 10-nanometer-based new addition to our portfolio of 5G capabilities. We are a leading silicon provider in 5G infrastructure, and Snow Ridge expands our reach to the fullest edges of the network. With major design wins at Ericsson, Nokia and ZTE, we expect to be the base station market segment leader by 2021, a year earlier than previously committed.
In the middle of this year, we'll debut our next-generation mobile processor, Tiger Lake. Using our second-generation 10-nanometer process, Tiger Lake will deliver breakthrough performance, and our customers have more than 50 fantastic Tiger Lake-based notebook designs lined up for the holiday season. Finally, in the latter part of 2020, we continue to expect initial production shipments of our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake. While product development in a work-from-home environment is extremely challenging, we are largely on track for our 2020 product deliverables.
We are always mindful of our role as stewards and thoughtful allocators of your capital. We generate significant cash flow and have an excellent balance sheet. We're committed to our dividends, and we repurchased $4.2 billion in shares during the quarter. In light of the uncertainty, we took some actions to dramatically strengthen our liquidity position that we felt were prudent. We raised $10.3 billion in debt to further underpin an already strong balance sheet, and we suspended our share buybacks. We think this level of conservatism is appropriate at this phase, and we intend to reinstate our buyback program as circumstances warrant. Our focus now is on investing in our products and process technology and ensuring we have the capacity to meet our customer needs.
We also continue to take a disciplined approach to our portfolio of investments, including an agreement to divest our Home Gateway Platform business. We have transformed our company to lead the data-driven revolution that's fueling our industry. Our belief is that opportunity is resolute. COVID-19 has only reinforced how important it is for Intel and our customers to accelerate the power of data to fight the current pandemic and avert the next one. To use Andy Grove's words, bad companies are destroyed by crises. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them. Guided by our cultural values, competitive advantages and financial strength, we will emerge from this situation even stronger.
I'll now hand the call over to George for more details on our Q1 results, our Q2 outlook and how we're actively managing the business through this challenge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 marked a strong start to the year amidst significant economic uncertainty and the unexpectedly strong demand for both PCs and servers as work-from-home and learn-from-home dynamics played out globally. Revenue came in at $19.8 billion, up 23% year-on-year and $800 million higher than guide. Data-centric revenue of $10.1 billion, up 34% year-on-year, represented 51% of our total revenue, an all-time high. Strong server demand across segments and a richer mix of our Xeon devices drove a significant portion of the upside. Q1 PC-centric revenue was $9.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year on strong notebook PC sales and increased supply resulting from capacity additions over the past year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 62%, beating expectations due to strong flow-through of higher platform revenue, partly offset by reserves associated with our memory business and from the sale of our Home Gateway Business. Operating margin of 38% in the quarter was up 10 points versus last year on higher gross margins and disciplined spending controls, consistent with the environment.
Q1 EPS was $1.45, $0.15 above our guide on strong operational performance, partially offset by losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios, along with the effects of a slightly higher tax rate. The strength of these results show the remarkable talent and commitment of our global workforce in a difficult and rapidly evolving environment.
In Q1, we generated $6.2 billion in operating cash flow and invested $3.3 billion in CapEx with $2.9 billion of free cash flow, up 76% year-over-year. We returned $5.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. As Bob mentioned, we announced a pause in our share repurchase program as we felt it was prudent to do so in the current economic environment. This does not change our commitment to returning $20 billion in repurchases as outlined in October last year, and we plan to resume the program when market dynamics stabilize. With Q1 buybacks at $4.2 billion, we have already more than offset expected dilution associated with employee stock compensation for this year. In addition, our dividend policy remains unchanged with $1.4 billion in dividends paid in Q1.
Let's move to segment performance in Q1. Data Center Group revenue of $7 billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectations with strength across our customer landscape. Year-over-year platform volumes and ASPs were up 27% and 13%, respectively. While year-over-year comparisons benefited from a weak Q1 '19, revenue in the quarter came in at the second-highest level ever for DCG. Revenue was up 53% in cloud, 34% in enterprise and government and 33% for communication service providers. DCG adjacencies also delivered solid growth with revenue up 35% year-on-year on strong adoption of networking solutions.
Our other data-centric businesses were up 19% year-over-year in Q1 despite more tangible COVID impact. IOTG operating income declined 3%, primarily on lower revenue from industrial and retail. Mobileye revenue and operating income were up 22% and 29%, respectively, driven by continued ADAS penetration and new IQ program launches, offset partially by eroding conditions in the automotive market. While Q1 marked a record for Mobileye revenue, we expect 2020 revenue growth will be lower than our prior expectations as automobile production and volume ramps are being materially impacted by COVID-19. NSG revenue grew 46% on strong bit growth and improved pricing. Better market conditions versus last year, along with cost reductions on strong factory performance, resulted in a lower operating loss of $66 million. PSG revenue grew 7% year-on-year on cloud and enterprise strength, partially offset by weaker embedded and communications segment. Operating income was up 9% on higher revenue.
CCG revenue was $9.8 billion in Q1, up 14% year-over-year, driven by notebook market strength and higher modem sales. PC unit volumes were up 13% year-over-year on higher notebook demand and increased supply. Notebook demand strength is expected to continue into Q2 with more people working and learning from home due to COVID-19-related shelter-in-place orders. Operating margin was 43%, up 7 points year-on-year, on higher revenue and lower spending driven by the 5G smartphone modem exits, partially offset by higher unit costs associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products.
Let's move to our second quarter outlook. Given the environment and the global economy, the range of potential outcomes has a wider distribution than normal. Based on demand signals from our customers, we expect the strength in cloud and comms infrastructure to continue in Q2, while IOTG and Mobileye will see lower demand driven by COVID-19. As a result, we expect total revenue of $18.5 billion with PC-centric approximately flat to slightly up year-over-year and data-centric up approximately 25% year-over-year. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%, down 1 point year-on-year on lower gross margin, largely offset by lower spending on higher revenue. Gross margins are expected to be approximately 56%, down 6 points sequentially due primarily to 3 reasons: prequalification reserves associated with the ramp of our next 10-nanometer client product, code named Tiger Lake; lower sequential revenue; and an accelerated ramp of 10-nanometer products, including isolate client CPUs and 5G SoC. The Tiger lake reserves are not expected to impact full year gross margin as we expect to sell through the reserve inventory in the second half of the year. As a result, Q2 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share.
Moving to the full year. With limited visibility due to the uncertainty driven by COVID-19, we are not guiding the full year. However, I do want to spend a few minutes discussing the expected headwinds and tailwinds we are monitoring and our response to the market dynamics.
Tailwinds are most evident in the first half of the year on strong demand for mobile compute and related infrastructure on the dynamics of sheltering in place. In particular, mobile PCs, cloud and network infrastructure for 5G remain above seasonal trends. Headwinds include the impact of a global recession on IOTG end markets, particularly industrial and retail, lower automotive production impacting Mobileye and slowing enterprise and government data center demand. We also expect the PC TAM to weaken in the second half as GDP effects outweigh the initial demand bump from COVID. Also, given the volatility of the margins in Q1, our losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios were negatively impacting EPS by $0.03. Given the uncertain environment, this remains a watch item for the remainder of the year. In response to these market dynamics, we acted swiftly and strengthened liquidity.
In addition to spending repurchases, we issued $10.3 billion in debt in the quarter. Our total cash investment balance at quarter end was $20.8 billion. Our liquidity actions to date are expected to impact full year EPS performance by approximately $0.12. The company has an exceptional balance sheet and strong cash flow to handle a very wide range of scenarios. We have positioned the company to support investment in technology transitions, our new products, and our customers' requirements across these scenarios. As you would expect, we are very focused on cash flow management and believe our free cash flow generation this year will be resilient as impacts from COVID are tempered by first half demand strength, OpEx savings initiatives, capital actions and tight working capital oversight.
To conclude, I'd like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide who are working diligently in these challenging times to provide products essential to the world.
With that, I'll hand it back to Trey, and we'll get to your questions.

All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first call.

================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Crédit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the gross margin decline heading into the calendar second quarter. George, you kind of broke it up into 3 different categories. I'd be interested on magnitude of Tiger Lake versus just lower volumes and then other 10-nanometer parts. And I guess, more importantly, how do we think about kind of normalized sort of gross margins as you get past some of the start-up costs for a faster 10-nanometer ramp?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, John. So the margin picture is really unchanged from what we've talked about in the past in terms of how we think our product road map is going to move products that we expect to introduce and their margin structure. And what you're seeing in Q2 is largely a timing issue. And about half of the impact that you're seeing in gross margin in the quarter is from the Tiger Lake pre PRQ reserves. Obviously, the fact that -- and that's both sequentially and year-over-year. And so I think the way we would look at it is pretty much we're not seeing anything as -- if you take COVID out of the year, we're really not seeing anything different in our basic view of gross margin dynamics, with the exception of we're seeing stronger pull-in of demand for some of our 10-nanometer products. I mean I think one of the things -- we got very strong demand for Tiger Lake. And so when you look at the impact that Tiger Lake reserves are having on the quarter, it's about the same level of impact that we had on Ice Lake in Q1 of '19. And yet we have about double the number of units in the -- being reserved. And I think it gives you an indication of just how much our performance was improving on 10-nanometer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So John, I would just say, relative to where we were 90 days ago, gross margins are stronger through the first quarter. They're in line with our expectations through the second quarter. And to George's point, despite the timing dynamics of pre PRQ reserves that we take in the second quarter and recoup in the second half, the only other change is just that we feel confident in accelerating the ramp for 10. So from our vantage point, at or better than kind of how we started the year, and we feel very good about gross margin performance. We're very excited about the Tiger Lake products ramping going into the second half and the 5G Snow Ridge product that we announced. So all in all, gross margin dynamics, pretty strong.
On the second part of your question, I'd go back to the commentary that George provided back at our Analyst Day in the spring, which is, obviously, when we transition from a mature node to a new node, margins tend to come down. We indicated that we plan to get back on a 2- to 2.5-year cadence, which means in 2021, we'll be ramping 10-nanometer even more while we're investing in 7-nanometer that we anticipate having in the fourth quarter of 2021. So those dynamics of -- from a mature node to a new node, impacts the gross margins of the business, but we feel like it's -- we're well on track from the plans we laid out and feel pretty good about a dynamite first quarter and an outlook for the second quarter in line or better than what we expected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blayne Peter Curtis, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess a follow-on, John, with the gross margin. I mean I know you're not guiding full year anymore, but when we look out at that trajectory that you had given us, I was wondering if you can just kind of step us through with the acceleration. And actually, maybe looking back to last year, if you look at the improvement you saw of that low quarter, just kind of any kind of directional guidance of where this gross margin can go from here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean first off, I think you're going to see, Blayne, that gross margin is going to improve, all things being equal, just from the fact that starting in the third quarter, we'll start to see the chips that have been reserved this quarter coming out on a 0 cost basis in the gross margin. And again, it's really hard to think about the second half in terms of how demand is going to look compared to what we ultimately thought when we first gave guidance, which is because of the -- all the obvious issues related to COVID. I'd just go back to -- as we look at what we guided all the way back in May of '19, if anything, we're ramping 10-nanometer a little faster. We're seeing clear evidence of improved performance on 10-nanometer. And so we feel good about the overall gross margin dynamics. You can see how our other cost initiatives are helping 5 points out of the 6-point impact that's being offset by effectively the OpEx percentage. So overall, I would go back and say no real change to our fundamental outlook. But when you overlay COVID, it's -- we'll just have to see how that plays out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I appreciate all the color in these uncertain times. I'm curious how you are directionally feeling about the CapEx guidance for the year. I think you had about a $17 billion number before. I understand the need to be responsive to the macro dynamics and in preserving the balance sheet. But you upsided first half by quite a bit, and you're also accelerating the move to 10-nanometers. Does that create some upward bias or at least protect the kind of capital spending plans that you had for the year? Any puts and takes would be very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Vivek, I'll start, and then George will fill in. First, both our R&D and our capital spend for this year are directed towards the multiyear plan that we shared with you back last year. So both the product road map over the next several years, the capital required to support the growth that we anticipate over the medium- to long-term horizon while adding capacity for the ramp of 10 as well. So coming into the year, we're very bullish about the medium- and long-term outlook. And we're putting our capital to work to support that medium- and long-term outlook, and that's not going to change.
That being said, in the near term, as we try to get a better read on what the demand signals will be for the second half, whether we're dealing with being very disciplined on our spending levels, ensuring that wafer starts are in line with true demand signals and being very disciplined on the capital that isn't directly related to more capacity and/or technology development, we are going to be very disciplined through this near-term horizon. But I'd just go back to the first point, which is we're very bullish about the multiyear view. We have the largest TAM in the company's history. We got a great set of products that we're building and developing, and we're going to invest to position ourselves well to capitalize on the current disruptions that we're wrestling with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. What I would add is there's some natural things in addition to the discipline that will help us lower CapEx a little bit. It's part of why we said we think our free cash flow is going to be pretty resilient in the year because we've seen in some of the geographies where we have major construction projects underway, we're actually seeing that being pushed somewhat by regulatory requirements. And so we -- the way I would describe it is we probably see 6 to 8 weeks' worth of capital pushing out of this year. But any capital that is important for our 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer and even the start of 5-nanometer is going to be spent in line with the timetables that we've already laid out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. I wonder if you could talk about some of the changes to the server road map? And it seems like you've deemphasized Cooper Lake and are more focused on Ice Lake server. Is that about confidence of the -- in the 10-nanometer plus? Is that -- just kind of describe what led to that decision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Joe. Yes, during the course of the year, we've been -- our product road map for servers is very focused on delivering workload-optimized platform foundation that's scalable for the real-world environments that our customers are operating in. So we ramped -- Skylake was the fastest ramp in the Xeon history, followed by Cascade Lake, that was a very strong ramp. Next, we have a Cascade Lake refresh that is a relatively simple, simple upgrade, easier upgrade for our customers because the architecture is very simple to the fastest-growing Cascade Lake ramp. And we're very focused on Ice Lake in the second half of the year or in the fourth quarter, as we indicated. So as we step back and look at the market dynamics and the product road map, we feel like we got the right products at the right time as we ramp and scale the high end of Cascade Lake and refresh while positioning for Ice Lake.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. That makes sense. And as you've started to ramp 10-nanometer plus, is it possible to talk about the changes that you'll see versus 10? Is it better clock speeds, better yields, better -- is there better transistor performance implicit in that transition?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I presume you're talking about second gen for server products, Sapphire Rapids product or -- oh, for clients, sorry. Yes, the client -- the Tiger Lake product, we are extremely excited about. We -- as I think I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have 50 designs that we expect to ramp in the holiday season this year. Clock speed, battery life, AI incorporation into the core design, a platform offering that we think is a real differentiator for customers on -- in thin and light format. So this is going to be a great launch. We're very excited about it. And to George's earlier point, the demand signals we're seeing and our confidence in both the product and the yield is -- has us at a point where we expect to accelerate the ramp and adoption a bit faster than we did coming into the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to ask first about the 10-nanometer mix exiting the year just given what you're seeing: a strong Tiger Lake demand signals and a potentially faster 10-nanometer. Like what do you think your product mix by node is going to be exiting the year? Do you think there'll be a crossover point on 10-nanometers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy, this is George. I don't think we'll see a crossover point this year. And this is -- again, I'm just going to take COVID out of the equation, so thinking through, I do think we're going to see more demand on 10-nanometer this year than we thought going in. Again, I think Ice Lake demand was strong -- is going to be strong in the first half. We're seeing our 5G SoCs on 10-nanometer getting stronger demand as the market there just gets stronger and stronger on the comp side. But Tiger Lake is really, I think, going to be the driver for us in being above our expectations for all the reasons that Bob just covered. And -- but it won't be enough to cause a crossover.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Clark Seymore, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to go to the Data Center Group, you have the color commentary about the enterprise and government being weaker in the second half, and I don't think that surprises anybody. But I wanted to see what sort of color you're getting in the other 70% of that segment on the cloud and the comms side? And specifically, you had worried earlier this year that we'd enter a digestion period. So I wanted to see if your views have changed on that. And then in the comms service provider side, how much of that actually acts like the enterprise and government versus the side that benefits from the 5G ramp? Any pluses and minuses there would be helpful as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Ross. First, on the cloud side, as you indicated, we came into the year off a very strong second half of 2019, and our expectations were that Q1 would continue that strength. But then the cloud service providers would go through their normal digestion stage, if you will. That was kind of what we indicated back in January. First quarter, as George flagged, demand was even stronger for the CSPs. In our raised outlook for Q2, we expect that demand for the cloud folks to -- the strong demand to continue. And possibly, even going into the second half of the year, that's TBD, but the trends are relatively encouraging, the demand signals are very high. The product that's being pulled is the XCC product. So ASPs, as you saw in our results, were very strong. So purchasing is extending beyond what we thought a few months ago. And that drove Q1 upside, it drove Q2 upside, and we think it will be relatively strong kind of going into Q3. That's TBD.
On the comms side, fantastic growth in the first quarter. Our expectations are, as we go through the course of the year, it will stay relatively strong as we continue to gain share in that segment. And as we've expanded the 5G SoC, expanded our TAM within that sector and with the product that we just qualified a few weeks back. So we expect share gains, the infrastructure -- share gains to continue, infrastructure in 5G to continue, if not go faster, and we're relatively well positioned in the -- with the key players of Nokia, Ericsson and ZTE going into the second half of the year. So we feel good about the comms segment as well. And as you flagged, the ones that we're proud -- that we're most anxious about is just enterprise and government and what kind of demand signals we'll see in the second half. So the first 2 are as good, if not stronger. Enterprise and government, a big -- a bit of an unknown for us at this stage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pierre C. Ferragu, New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology Infrastructure [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd like to get back to your performance in PC in the first quarter. So you're up 14% year-on-year. I was wondering a couple of things. The first one is how much is that really stronger demand, and that's just about it? And how much of that is more you catching up on capacity and being better able to serve the market and catching up maybe on demand you couldn't meet in the 2, 3 previous quarters? And then what's your early view on market share? Are you starting to regain share in PCs? And if not, when do you see that happening this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pierre, it's George. I think what we saw is clearly some impact relative to our expectations from the work-at-home, learn-at-home dynamics. But we had expected a strong quarter in our initial forecast, which really reflected the dynamics that we're talking about. We had customers who have been short of demand for a number of quarters who were seeing a chance to finally build some -- a little bit of inventory, which gave us a seasonally strong first quarter relative to anything we might see historically. But we saw notebook volumes up over 20% in the quarter. And I would say that that's more than just the pent-up demand. And that's at a time when some of the OEMs were really struggling in the early part of the quarter with their supply chains, which is why there's some parts in their channel that's all opened up now. So we think that actually -- one of the good signs is though even that's opened up, we're still seeing very strong demand coming in on the PC side. So -- and we had expected solid PC in the first half. But I would say it's -- with COVID, it's been even stronger and heavily weighted towards the netbook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the only thing I would add is in our fab network and the supply chain was able to -- coming out of last year, not only able to deal with the backlog coming into the year but also meet the higher demand signals that George flagged at the latter part of March.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I should have mentioned that. It's really heroic work, both at the supply chain level, we have a fantastic supply chain group, but also our manufacturing teams, keeping the factories up and running. Delivering a 90% on-time commits in a quarter like this is really remarkable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I realized that you removed your guidance for the full year. But if I look at your results and your guide for Q2, it would suggest data-centric tracking, maybe down 2% half-on-half in the second half; and PC, down 14%. I'm just curious, is that directionally how you're seeing things? Or I guess given the positive trends in notebooks and the weakness on the enterprise and government side, perhaps it's a bit more muted, and would love to hear your thoughts on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. We're -- I'm not going to be able to give you a full year guide by pieces. But I appreciate the question. I think the -- maybe talking a little bit, C.J., headwinds and tailwinds, which we referred to on the call, clearly, cloud is a tailwind and -- cloud and mobile compute are a tailwind for the first half for sure. I think cloud continues to be -- will probably be helpful throughout the year. The -- but at some point, we're going to see the impacts of the recession start to impact demand on PCs. So we're -- that's certainly a headwind. That is a reasonable expectation for the second half of the year. We're already seeing the impact of the recession on IOTG, particularly in industrial and retail.
We're seeing in automotive, Mobileye had a record quarter in Q1. But I think the full year is going to be certainly weaker than we had expected coming into the year. Now not nearly as weak as automotive overall because they continue to grow. They're in a part of the automotive market that is growing substantially. And they have the leadership position in ADAS. And so it will be more subtle of an impact, but still an impact nonetheless. And then as Bob said, on the data center side, enterprise and government appear to have been very strong in the first half, and so we would expect some digestion. How those things all play up and what percentages play out, C.J., I really can't say, but those are the things that we're watching to see how the year is going to play out.

Operator [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from SMBC Nikko.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri, SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George, I want to go back to the gross margins. I think you did a great job giving us color about half of the impact from Tiger Lake. I'm just wondering, the remaining half, is that because of reserves, which is going to reverse in the second half? Or is this something more structural or mix related that's going to persist for the next few quarters? I would love to hear some color on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think the things that are structural is we're going to see more 10-nanometer demand in the year than we had forecasted at the beginning of the year. And that will have a little bit of dampening on margins but not materially different from what we had seen coming into the year. The temporary impact is really the reserve action, which will reverse. It is about half of the year-over-year effect. And so I would say the other impact, again, is if we look year-over-year, we're just seeing a much larger uptake of Ice Lake and 5G SoCs year-over-year, but much of that was expected. I would say both Ice Lake and the 5G SoCs are a little bit stronger than we would have thought coming into the year and -- which is consistent with just the demand activity that we're seeing in mobility and the infrastructure around that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. And just we came into the year with an outlook of 59% gross margin for the year. And I would just say through the first 90 days, we're much better. To the next 90 days, we're better or in line. And the dynamics of the pre PRQ reserve are no impact on the full year. Therefore, net-net, to the first 6 months of the year, we feel just as good about our gross margin performance and even better about our ability to ramp 10-nanometer. So we're feeling very good about how the first half of the year is playing out relative to where we were 90 days ago across demand signals and gross margin performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm just wondering if you can talk about channel. Inventory, there's a -- customers in a lot of your end markets seem to be a little concerned about supply disruptions, and they -- sell-in seems to be a little bit above sell-through. Sell-through seems to be weakening a little bit. So can you talk about the potential for some inventory correction later this year and sort of how you track that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're -- obviously, we're very focused on understanding that. I would say the -- any kind of dislocation that we're looking at right now is more a function of just the supply chain challenges that some of the OEMs had, particularly in the first half of the first quarter. But we've been watching that pretty closely because we want to make sure that this kind of buildup at our customer level makes its way through to the end customer. And we're seeing customers telling us that their end-customer demand continues to be very strong, and their order profile reflects they're going to clear their existing revenue. Now when that plays out, I'm not sure. It's part of why we struggle to understand how that second half is going to play out. But we feel good about the demand signals we're seeing now, and we understand the movements of our products in the system from the dynamics that we saw in the first quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trey Campbell, Intel Corporation - Head of IR [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator, I think we have time for one more question, and then we'll turn the call back over to Bob to wrap things up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our final question then comes from Chris Danely from Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Brett Danely, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD & Analyst [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you just run down the supply demand sort of balance throughout the server, desktop and notebook lines? I guess are you on track for the high single-digit unit increase in output? And then did the shortages anywhere get any worse during the during Q1? Or it sounds like they're abating in certain areas? Just any color there would be great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. On -- as we indicated at the beginning of the year, our intention -- well, we did add capacity last year, and our intention this year was to add another mid-20% growth in capacity, which would generate real strong output. And we are on track, maybe even a little bit better than what we said at the time. Obviously, in the first quarter, demand was also greater. It was greater for -- across the board, server and notebook, in particular. And we were able to keep pace with accelerating demand as the quarter closed. So we're in pretty good shape in terms of the promise we've made to our customers, and that is that we will not -- we'll put the capacity in place so we are not a constraint on their growth. So we're in very good shape despite all the challenges. That being said by, we haven't replenished inventory levels. So meaning mix dynamics across the board is -- we're still not quite there yet, but we're in line a little bit better than we had hoped. We delivered more demand, and we got to continue to build the inventory levels back so we can deal with the variation by SKU mix.
Yes. So look, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. I just kind of want to wrap with -- to reiterate our purpose, and that is to create world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth. And that's never been more important than it is during this time. Our strategy is resolute, and our business is built to withstand challenges. We have a very diversified portfolio of businesses that are highly leveraged to major technology inflections like cloud, 5G, intelligent and autonomous edge computing and artificial intelligence. We generate significant and durable free cash flows, and our team of 110,000 people is operating as one team to enable our customers' success. So guided by our cultural values, our competitive advantages and our financial strength, we're confident that we will emerge from this situation even stronger.
Thanks again for joining us. We hope you all stay safe as we work together to overcome this global crisis. And we look forward to hopefully seeing you in person over the near term. Thanks again for joining us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wanted to ask if you had any update on the state of the advertising business? Sort of the state of conversations with advertisers, what product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of '17 and into 2018, broadly, for the platform?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Sure, Eric. I would say, advertising continues to be a bright spot, both from a product standpoint, and also, financially. It was -- continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the -- in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item. So we -- our philosophy there, again, is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise, and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers, generally, are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they want to reach our customers, generally, to drive brand awareness, discovery, and eventually, purchase. Before I go on to the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years, actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and 1-day options. And our 2-day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits, like Prime Video. The value of Prime to customers has never been greater. And the cost is also high. As we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119, for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16. Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. And Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, I just want to remind folks that we've mentioned this last quarter on the call, but on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies. So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas. As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services are classified as revenue, rather than a reduction of costs to sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is the other revenue was, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure. So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter, again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is -- would be included in the North America segment. As you look at the other supplemental line items, just a few items of note. The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex FX. Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, certain digital media content, are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than net online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard. And then, the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex FX year-over-year. Prime members are -- Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period. Prior to 2018, we recognize this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year. So in Q1 of this year's subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So the first one, on Prime, let me ask you this. As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S. are not signing on for Prime at this point? And the second one, on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now and Whole Foods, recognizing it's only in a few cities. What can you share about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly to roll that out to more cities in the U.S., and hopefully, New York soon?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. There's discounted student plans. There's also discounts for other groups. So we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day. The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime -- those markets using Prime Now. So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what'll -- what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath Patrick Terry, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was just wondering if you could give us a sense. The accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S. business in Q1, how much of that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? Are there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving that? And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer you specifically call out sort of customer additions in some of your comments, what customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. So first, with the -- you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure, but the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime Flywheel, so we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime Benefits, especially Digital and Benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things. We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple -- Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So not much more I can add by product line to North America. Now I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're -- we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last 2 quarters. The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate. So what we're seeing is just continued strong usage, both by existing customers and signing new customers for -- see an increased pace of enterprise migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly trying new services. We are seeing people move more and more of their workloads to AWS and at a faster pace. And customers are moving databases to AWS as their work continues to grow at a very rapid clip. So stepping back, I would say, what is driving the growth, we believe, again, it's the value that we create for AWS customers. We have the functionality and pace of innovation that others don't. We have partner and ecosystem that others don't, and we have proven operational capability and security expertise that's highly valued to AWS customer base.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Alan May, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the data that we've seen suggests that this year, your -- the rate of growth in the build out of fulfillment centers and other parts of the retail logistics network as well as data centers, but more on the former, that rate of growth is slowing this year relative to last year and even the year before. I know that you guys go through periods of kind of heavy investment then you grow into that capacity. But I just wonder if you could comment a little bit about where we are kind of in that ebb and flow of that cycle right now. And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier, with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Mark, this is Dave. On that second question, we've not commented on the growth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say there. As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised or other revenue, rather, that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%, but again, that's not in relation to the COGS portion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And on the question on capacity, excuse me, cap -- I'll address this CapEx and capital leases, we're still seeing strong investment there. If I look at the quarterly trends, you're right that this quarter was up 33% in isolation versus last year. I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year. So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment and warehouses. So if I step back on the trailing 12 months though, CapEx, which is predominantly tied to our fulfillment center network, is up 47%. That is above the Amazon fulfilled unit growth rate, but we've combined the strength of the FBA program and the space requirements as we -- get into bigger and bigger products. That -- it's a representative number for that period. On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the AWS business, that's up 49% year-over-year on the trailing 12 months. So again, usage rates continue to exceed the revenue growth rates. Usage rates are strong, but we also have a number of projects underway that seek to increase our efficiency of our data centers. So there's a couple of things at play there that, hopefully, keep that number closer to the revenue growth rate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian, you had significant operating income upside in 1Q and I think a better outlook for the second quarter than many expected. Can you just talk about the biggest factors that drove the delta relative to your 1Q guide? And is there any reason to think that you couldn't see similar leverage in the back half of the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Yes, we came in well above our range that we had given of $300 million to $1 billion. I would attribute it primarily to a few things. First, the top line growth was -- continued to be strong coming out of Q4. We had great consumer business strength. We also had strong AWS revenue strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, which is a different trend than we've seen recently. So customer adoption and AWS remained strong. And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on -- with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given our -- the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers, and quite frankly, people. So we saw great efficiencies at the higher level of revenue, and we're able to handle it. So that was generally very good financially. We -- at the time of guidance, we were concerned a bit about the high -- relatively high inventory we had at year-end in space utilizations. We were still very full in our fulfillment centers. But we were able to correct that due to the high sales without handling -- without having additional handling and transportation cost that you would normally see to reconfigure inventory locations. So that also helped and probably was a differential versus the guidance estimate. And then, lastly, I would say, advertising continues to be a strong contributor to profitability and had strong results this quarter. As far as what that portends for future quarters, for now, I want to focus on Q2 and it's incorporated into our Q2 guidance. So we expect a lot of the strength areas to continue, consumer demand, AWS and advertising. We will definitely see higher investments as we move through the year. For example, video content spend will increase year-over-year, and we'll continue to hire, in particular, software engineers. We'll have some cost in Q2 ahead of what's anticipated to be a Prime Day in early Q3. So -- and then as you know, Q3 is generally a lower quarter due to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building teams. So I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with customer reception we had in Q1, and then, the income that that drove.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two questions. That $239 million in other income, what was that? And then, could you just wax a little bit, eloquently, hopefully, on advertising revenue? And like how do you balance what our -- what should be a monstrous amount of ad revenue opportunities, especially high-profit, high-margin ad revenue opportunities against an ideal or optimal consumer experience? These sponsored units I see in every search I do on Amazon seems great from an advertising perspective, but I sometimes wonder if it doesn't dilute to consumer experience. So just talk about how you balance that. And then, finally, as part of advertising, you've got, also, a heck of a lot inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you don't allow -- that you don't directly charge for. How do you think about that as an advertising revenue opportunity?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Let me wax eloquently, try to anyway. So let's start with the $239 million, that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we've partnered with. We have transportation companies that we've partnered with and other technology companies. As the stock market increased in Q1, a lot of those companies also went up. So that's where we book the gain on warrants that we have with -- on investments. It's also -- there was a good bit of FX gain due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar. That showed up on a lot of lines on the P&L, but that one was positive. On advertising, so let's step back a bit. It's now a multibillion-dollar program and growing very quickly. Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products. So when we show sponsored products, we're trying to show people things that they had -- maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their normal search results. So we're looking for a good balance here, as we said. We want customers to get the benefit of the new brand and product discovery, and then, we want to let sellers, for both emerging and established brands, reach those customers. Those advertisers are all shapes and sizes with the main goal of, again, trying to reach our customers whether it's to drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully, purchase. So we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always balancing the helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it disruptive. But you're right, there are always pressures in that we will come down on the side of the customer. On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose to not do that right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. The only thing I'd add too on that, just related to Prime Video. As you may have seen the announcement earlier today, about the renewed agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Night Football. So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL. We've done some things like the Prime Original Series, All or Nothing, the third season's coming up soon, focused on the Dallas Cowboys. So that was one of our first forays in the live format that -- one of the first forays in the live format where we had live ads and kind of not only learning the technology, but learning to -- learning that business. And I think we've been pleased with what we've seen so far, obviously, and look forward to the next few seasons with the NFL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen D. Ju, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I think, Brian, I had a question on your international shopping rollout. So I think this was recently announced. Where do you think you measure up versus some of the more local players where you might not have a direct presence in the country? And where do you think your value proposition lies? And presumably this is informed by users coming in from those regions where you don't really have an official site, but people come in to buy stuff from you anyway. So which regions or countries are accounting for most of the demand that you are seeing?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stephen, if you're still on, can you elaborate on the countries you're talking about, specifically?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen D. Ju, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, I'm just wondering, you already have a direct presence in some of the countries like China, Japan, et cetera, and the international shopping rollout presumably expands, so that's selection to most of the globe. So just wondering if you are seeing incremental demand, and where you might be seeing demand coming in from countries where you might not have a direct presence?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh, on the global store? Okay. Yes. Yes. Sorry, I thought you meant to some of our expansion countries. So yes, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in -- who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country. So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd like to maybe dive into a couple of the local recent overhangs. First, on shipping partners, just wondering how dependent are you on any shipping partner? And can you talk about any initiatives you've had to build out your own shipping network? I know in some countries, you might be over 50% of the stuff you're delivering. Could you talk a little bit about dependency there? And then, secondly, on taxes, can you remind us what happened when Amazon started collecting taxes on your own items in various states, and just kind of overview of your view on collecting third-party sales -- taxes from third parties in other states if that were to pass?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Let me start with transportation. We have a great group of carriers that we use globally and you know who they are, but we're also growing our teams and capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume on our own, particularly around the holiday season. So that's driven a lot of our expansion of Amazon Logistics, it's driven the creation of sort centers, it's driven the purchase of airplanes to move product between points within our delivery network. So we will continue to operate with this combination of external partners and internal capability. We like what we see so far with our Amazon Logistics capability. It's well over 50% in some countries, particularly the U.K. It helps with, again, Prime Now and AmazonFresh and a lot of initiatives that we'll see, which again, we've mentioned that Prime Now is tied in with Whole Foods, now in 10 cities. So we think it's a core competency that we have and we need to have, and we'll continue to invest in that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes, Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, and Justin, this is Dave, just on the sales tax piece. Today, on the first-party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a state-imposed sales tax. On the 3P piece, we do collect on behalf of our sellers in 2 states, Washington State as of the first of this year and then, Pennsylvania turned on here on April 1. So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party pieces coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years. So nothing really more to add on that. I think I would say we do continue to believe that the sales tax issue needs to be resolved at the federal level, and we're actively working with the states, with retailers and Congress to get federal legislation passed. We're not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitutionally-permissible system that is both simple and applied evenhandedly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gregory Scott Melich, MoffettNathanson LLC - Partner [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to follow up on Prime little bit. The fee increase, why now? I mean, we've been adding value for a long time, obviously, shipping costs are going up. Why is now the right time to have that fee hike, especially since membership looks like the growth number's starting to slow? And tied into that, there's a lot of Alexa mentioned in the release. Could you give us some uptake on the importance of Alexa and basically voice commerce, and so the metrics you get in terms of usage there and the flywheel?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. We always evaluate the price of Prime in all the countries we're in, and we're looking for creative ways to reach the customer, as I mentioned earlier, create -- or excuse me, monthly plans, student plans, et cetera. So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefit it's delivering. I mentioned that 4 years ago, when we last increased the price of Prime, if you get 20 million products within 2 days, today you can get over 100 million products within 2 days, and many, many, many, products within 1 day, same day, or 2 hours. So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program. It's much different than it was in 2014. This is a reflection of that, that's a better reflection of the cost value of the program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Ryan Blackledge, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - Head of Internet Research, MD and Senior Research Analyst [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So the U.S. international revenue mix, ex Whole Foods and ex AWS, looks about 64%, 36%. Given investments in international markets, would you envision international kind of closing the gap in the coming years? And what would be the key drivers of the mix shift getting closer to 50-50?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Yes, I don't want to project relative proportions of the different segments, but what I can say is, that international continues to see the same level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North America. So when we add Benefits, Prime Benefits, we're probably adding them at an earlier stage of life in the Prime program internationally than we did in the U.S. So they have different dynamics. We think, at the end of the day, customers behave the same globally, and that they value low prices, selection and great customer experience. So we'll continue to make these investments in Prime. We'll continue to expand selection, continue to build FBA programs so that it increases selection even more and build great partnerships with sellers. We'll continue to accelerate shipping. We'll continue to lower prices. And sorry, I cut out -- the last person got cut off a bit. We'll continue to build device business globally including Alexa, which we think has great stickiness with -- in the home and I think creates a lot of value in the home and also allows you to access, over time, Amazon products better. We'll continue to invest in India where we're seeing great progress with both sellers, and also, customers. And we like the momentum we've seen there. The Prime program started in the first year in India, grew faster than any Prime -- excuse me, any Prime program we had seen in other countries. We're adding local content in India -- video content, excuse me. We're also adding other benefits, Prime Benefits. We are rolling out devices there, and we're seeing Indian developers developing skills for Alexa, and Alexa's up -- as you saw the press release, to 40,000 skills
(technical difficulty)
But it's -- it is important to us that they all are still delighting customers and growing to the best of their ability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud and desktop search, resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency.
For today's call, I will begin with results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and we'll conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which, we will take your questions.
Starting with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $33.7 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $385 million or $305 million after the impact of our hedging program.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.5 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 19%. APAC revenues were $5.4 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year and up 28% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which continue to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
Operating expenses were $11.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Once again, the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing headcount, primarily for Cloud and Ads, followed by advertising investments in Cloud, Chromebooks for the back-to-school season and the Google Assistant.
G&A expense trends in the third quarter were affected by a number of factors. In particular, the performance fees accrued in connection with recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily to other cost of revenues.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.2 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 94,372, up 5,314 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating margin of 25%. As discussed in the previous 2 quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility. Once again, we've provided a table in our earnings press release to highlight the impact on particular line items.
Other income and expense was $1.8 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 8.8% for the third quarter, reflecting discrete items, notably an adjustment associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Net income was $9.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $13.06.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.3 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13.2 billion with free cash flow of $7.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $106 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment.
Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $24.1 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search.
Network revenues were $4.9 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic. Other revenues for Google were $4.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud and Play.
We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.6 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 20% year-over-year. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was relatively flat year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites, offset by an increase in the sites TAC rate. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC.
This quarter, we experienced a year-on-year decline in the network TAC rate due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 23% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.5 billion, up 11% versus last year. And the operating margin was 28.2%.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities. Let me now turn to Other Bets. Revenues were $146 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $727 million. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $55 million. In terms of Other Bets updates for the quarter. With Waymo in the third quarter, we built and our Early Rider Program, both expanding the group of participants and beginning to test pricing models. At Verily, the team continues to execute on its various partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies, consistent with its mission to move medicine from reactive to proactive. Recently launched efforts included joint venture with ResMed to focus on sleeping disorders and a research collaboration with Gilead.
Finally, you can see in our results the benefit and quality of our investment teams, GV and CapitalG, which are also within Other Bets. Within the $1.4 billion of reported gains in equity securities in OI&E, approximately $400 million was realized in Q3. There will be more detail on these investment activities in the 10-Q.
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. In the third quarter, results reflect FX headwinds with the U.S. dollar strengthening, in contrast to the tailwinds that enhanced reported results in the first half of the year. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum in our advertising businesses as we apply our strengths in machine learning to improve the experience for users and advertisers. As we noted, hardware was only a modest contributor in the third quarter as we launched a new Made by Google family of products for the fourth quarter holiday season.
Second, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. We indicated on the fourth quarter 2017 call that the pace of year-on-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues would begin to slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that again clearly in our results this quarter.
As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search. Looking ahead, we expect seasonal impacts to our other cost of sales from hardware sales, which are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the year as well as from increased content acquisition cost for YouTube, which have also historically been higher in the fourth quarter.
Within OpEx, we continue to prioritize our investments to support long-term growth. In terms of headcount, growth was seasonally higher in the third quarter because we brought on new graduates. We are continuing to invest in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in engineering and product management, and to support our most sizable growth areas, in particular, Cloud. As I've mentioned previously regarding sales and marketing, expenses are more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year. As you have seen in prior years, these expenses are particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season.
Other Bets remains a portfolio of earlier-stage businesses focused on addressing sizable markets. We are moving toward early stages of commercialization while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment against achievement of key milestones.
And finally, with respect to CapEx, you can see our continued investment as we build the infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see across our businesses. This includes a number of data center construction projects in-flight as well as ongoing expansion in our compute capacity.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Ruth. We had a great quarter, and it was particularly special because last month, we celebrated Google's 20th birthday and the 10th birthday of Chrome. It's exciting to think that 20 years in, we are still just at the beginning of what's possible. We get billions of questions from users every day, and about 15% of those are queries we have never seen before.
Our mission to make the world's information accessible and useful is as relevant today as when we started. I want to begin by highlighting our recently launched family of hardware. It's a great example of how we bring together Google's strengths to help people through their day. Then I'll touch on ways AI is helping us approach our mission. I'll give an update on our video and advertising platforms. And finally, I'll talk about our growing Cloud business.
First, hardware. Every year, we have a new opportunity to push the boundaries of computing. Those experiences come to life in our Made by Google hardware, which combines the latest advances in software, hardware and AI.
Our third-generation is our best yet. It includes the Pixel 3, Google Home Hub, the Pixel Slate tablet and more. We're getting great feedback, and I'm very excited for users to try these devices, especially as the holiday season approaches.
Our new hardware lineup showcases the best of Google, including the Google Assistant, Android and Chrome. With the Pixel 3, we've used AI to create a best-in-class camera. New features like Top Shot make it so you never miss a shot. If your timing wasn't perfect, the camera will suggest a better frame and give you the option to save it. And Night Sight will help you take really good pictures even in bad light. Pixel 3 also has a custom security chip called Titan M. It was built to secure Google's own data centers, and now we are bringing it to our users. We also released Google Home Hub, our first smart speaker with a screen. It shows your morning commute, let's you control your smartphone and gives you hands-free help in the kitchen. And Pixel Slate Chrome OS reimagined as a tablet with all the great apps from the Play Store.
Our hardware efforts are picking up real momentum. For example, daily active users of our Google Home devices have grown by over 5x in the last year alone. I'm incredibly proud of our growing hardware team, including the talented employees who came over from HTC and Nest. Our investments are paying off as we bring the best of Google to more users and in more countries around the world.
Even as we build up our hardware business, we continue to advance our mission across our core products and platforms. Last month, we kicked off 20 years of Google Search by introducing some of the biggest updates in many years. They include a new AI-powered ranking approach that delivers more relevant results, a redesigned Google Feed called Discover to help you stay informed on topics that matter to you, and a new search experience for Google Images.
We also continue to tackle the information problem of connecting people to relevant jobs right from search. This has already helped connect over 100 million people in 92 countries to job listings that meet their needs and skills. Now U.S. service members can search for jobs for veterans and enter their military occupational code to see relevant civilian jobs. The Google Assistant continues to gain traction, drawing on our strengths in machine learning and helpful Google services like Search, YouTube and Maps. We have expanded the Assistant to 20 languages and 76 countries, and it can now understand and speak more than one language at a time. We launched our first set of smart displays with Lenovo and JBL as well as our own Google Home Hub.
Pixel users in the U.S. will be the first to try our new Duplex technology, which helps you complete real-world tasks over the phone, like calling a restaurant to book a table. And we introduced a new way to easily book ride services with your Google Assistant.
In Maps, we also made several improvements, including a commute tab with live traffic and transit information and support for mixed-mode commutes. Earlier this month, we announced an exciting test called Project Stream. We are working with video game publisher, Ubisoft, to stream their latest game, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, to Chrome browsers on laptops and desktops. Streaming graphically rich content for video games represents a great technical advance, and we look forward to seeing what's possible here.
I'm particularly proud that our strengths in AI are creating life-changing contributions in other fields. For example, our recent flood prediction efforts, which use AI to better predict when floods will occur, has the potential to help millions of people get out of harm's way. We are starting in India, where 20% of flood-related fatalities occur today, and we're looking to expand to more countries soon.
Earlier this month, our research has showed how they've applied deep learning models to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for metastatic breast cancer. Our research found that pathologists and AI can work together more effectively than either alone.
Moving to our video and advertising platforms, which are creating economic opportunities for partners around the world. First, YouTube. One particular area of focus is educational content. Every day, people from all over the world turn to YouTube to learn something new, from career skills to coding to cooking. Just this week, we announced a $20 million investment to expand our YouTube learning initiative, which will help fund established and emerging educational careers. We are also partnering with organizations like Goodwill and Year Up to create curated playlists that teach career skills directly in our new learning channel. YouTube's ads business continues to provide great results for marketers and creators. At Advertising Week, we announced that we'll be expanding our popular TrueView actions format. This helps users take action directly from video ads. They can now do things like sign up for a newsletter. And soon, they'll be able to find movie showtimes, download apps or even book a trip right from the ad. For creators, YouTube is continuing to build alternative revenue products, like Super Chat, Channel Memberships and the ability to sell merchandise directly to fans. YouTube Gaming creator, Markiplier, increased its revenue by 20% using Channel Memberships. We continue to see positive traction for our newest subscription experiences too. YouTube Premium, YouTube TV and YouTube Music premium are continuing to expand to many new countries. The team is also investing in growing and improving the news experience on YouTube. More prominently surfacing credible news sources on the platform is a big priority for us.
Next, our advertising platforms. Advertisers love that we are bringing our machine learning strengths to offerings like responsive search ads and Universal App Campaigns to create more effective ads. One new example is Smart Shopping campaigns, which use signals like seasonality and price to optimize where ads are shown. Tens of thousands of advertisers are using this and seeing an average of 20% more sales for the same budget. Just last week, we announced that Nike, Best Buy and Sephora are joining our Shopping Actions program. This allows people to move seamlessly from browsing to buying with a universal cart that works across Google Search and our system.
In apps, we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile gaming titles across 1.5 billion devices. Unity's developers can monetize their apps with Google Ads without any additional development work. And lastly, our growing Cloud business.
At Google Cloud Next, we made over 100 announcements, including the Titan security key, which features Google-designed firmware to help verify that nothing on a customer's key has been tampered with. And we expanded our breakthrough Cloud AutoML portfolio, which now includes vision, natural language and translation.
And all over the world, we are seeing great customer adoption of our Cloud Platform. With the help of SAP, Metro, one of our largest B2B wholesalers globally, is centralizing their finance system on Google Cloud Platform. They're using BigQuery to generate data-driven insights to help create more personalized marketing campaigns.
In the U.S., we partnered with the National Institutes of Health to provide access to Cloud services that help researchers access large data sets to accelerate biomedical advances. We also added new customers like ING and Broadcom, joining existing customers like PayPal, ANZ Bank and Kroger. Our G Suite business continues to fuel transformation in companies large and small, and we crossed 2 important milestones in the quarter. Google Drive became the eighth Google product with 1 billion monthly active users. And Gmail now has more than 1.5 billion monthly active users. One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer best known for its popular brand, UNIQLO, which is migrating its employees globally to G Suite, while also pursuing AI solutions like on-demand forecasting on Google Cloud Platform. Our Cloud business is benefiting from our investments in technical infrastructure, including a U.S.-Europe cable that will improve speeds for millions of people.
Before I wrap up, I want to quickly call out our continued momentum in Asia as well as the investments that we are making in the U.S. As you can see from our results, revenue growth in APAC remains strong. This is a reflection of our very focused efforts to build great experiences for the billions of people across the region. We have adapted many of our core products like Search, Maps and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users coming online.
We're also building products to meet the specific needs of users in the region like Tez, a digital payments app for India to help people easily pay their electrician or split a dinner bill with just a few taps. Just 1 year since it launched, over 30 million people in businesses across India now use the app every month, and they've collectively made more than 1 billion transactions. We have recently rebranded the app to Google Pay as we look to bring many of the app's features to others around the world. We are also investing closer to home. In Q3, more than 80% of Alphabet's total capital expenditures was within the U.S. Not only do these investments in data centers, machines and offices allow us to provide great services to users, they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them, supporting thousands of jobs and countless local businesses.
This year-to-date, we have added over 9,000 new employees in the U.S., and we continue to grow faster outside the Bay Area than in it. As you can see, there's exciting momentum across many different areas. I'm constantly struck by the number of incredible opportunities ahead of us as a company and how far we have come over the last 20 years. I want to say a big thank you to all of the Googlers around the world who help us deliver on that mission every day.
With that, I'll hand it back to Ruth

Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions.

================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe 2 for Sundar, if I can. Referencing the blog posts and some of the changes about how you see the future of Search, I wanted to know what are some of the key investments you think the company needs to make so that Search becomes more visual or relevant. And what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with your products, relevancy of ads over the medium to long term. And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear from advertisers there is some blurring between brand and direct response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended lines. It sounds like the YouTube announcements coming out of Ad Week were about making YouTube more responsive or more direct response. How are you thinking about the blurring of those lines and what it means for product development long-term?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Eric. I'll take the two. The first on Search. You're right that with Search, we are always trying to anticipate where users -- what the user experience expectations are and trying to meet them there. And increasingly in mobile, people do want immersive, engaging experiences. They want their experiences to be more visual, and that's partly what you saw us announce in our 20th birthday event. And we are excited to move in that direction. And I do think we have a lot of important assets to bring here. YouTube is a big part of what we do. We are investing in image search, and we do have products like Google Maps and Photos, which all add to that visual experience. And as part of doing that, we are investing in our advertising offerings as well. And so over time, we'll adapt that so they go hand-in-hand. But I think it's an important evolution for us. In terms of YouTube, I think it is -- part of what makes YouTube great is I think we can offer different opportunities for advertisers. We've always felt direct response is something that can work well on YouTube, and our instinct is bearing out. And I look at my personal use cases. There are many times now, sometimes instead of search, I actually find something I want to do in YouTube, maybe thinking about going to a place and I research it on YouTube. So I think it offers the same opportunity over time. And from our standpoint, we want to make sure we are evolving the product to bring those opportunities to advertisers. I'm very excited about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniel Salmon, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Media and Internet Analyst [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sundar, 2 questions for you. First, earlier this month, or it might have been late last month, Sridhar Ramaswamy, your Head of Ads and Commerce, left to go to a VC firm. Betting that wasn't a surprise to you, but I'm just hoping you could shed a little light on sort of succession planning for that important role and whether or not you expect any sort of broad changes to ad product strategy. And then second, just amongst those announcements on the anniversary were the evolution of Feed to Discover. And I recognize that's an evolution of a product, but it does look like you're taking advantage of that long-unused white space on Google.com. And so just love to hear a little bit more, that's sort of a follow-up on Eric's question on the evolution of Search, but how you see that surface, in particular, evolving and particularly the potential for ad monetization over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good. On the first one, look, I mean, we -- one of the things I'm really proud about Google is we have a deep bench of talent and, for example, in the Ads team, almost all of our senior Ads leadership has been here for well over a decade. And so for us, we are fortunate to be able to tap into it. Our Ads leadership comes -- Prabhakar, who has taken over our Ads product and engineering efforts, is someone I worked with for many, many years, and most recently has led our G Suite business, but has done many roles before as a deep computer scientist. And I expect to -- for him to continue our tradition of technical excellence with which he approach our advertising work. Also, I want to mention Philipp and his team, his extraordinary team, who definitely lead many of our initiatives here. And Philipp and, Prabhakar, with them, I think it's in great hands. And I expect a lot of continuity there. On your question on Search and Discover, it's -- in addition to making Search more visual, one of the things we are very, very focused on is not always do users turn to us and actually ask a question. So we feel our job is to be there when users need us, anticipate what they want and, sometimes, proactively meet them. That's where services like Discover really play a role, right? I think -- and we are thinking hard about how we can surface relevant information for our users, stuff they are really looking for, can act on in a way in which it's delightful for them and it's showing up for them when they need it. So I see that as an important evolution of Search as well. And so you're going to see us investing more. Mobile offers us a great opportunity. And if you use it in Pixel 3, that's the latest product in which we bring our vision of how to bring all these products together. And we'll give you a good sense of how we plan to do that over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore ISI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anthony Joseph DiClemente, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First for Sundar, you spent some time on hardware. You spent time discussing your suite of hardware devices, the Google Assistant, the Pixel. How are you measuring the returns on those investments in hardware, both in the products and on the marketing side here, in a pretty competitive marketplace? What are the milestones for success that we should be looking for on hardware? And then for Ruth, as we start to look ahead to 2019, as you plan for '19, how are you thinking about the relationship between revenue growth and dollars of operating income growth for next year, particularly if the macroeconomic environment were to become, let's say, less of a tailwind to the broader ads environment as it was this year and in prior years?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On hardware, we always want to be at the forefront of computing. And so -- and a lot of times, that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing together the entire experience in an integrated way for our users. And we genuinely see a very differentiated way to do this. We think our approach of bringing together AI, software and hardware is unique, and we think we can deliver the best-in-class experience. And we are committed to doing it. At the same time, we want to build a great business here as well. So we are investing in the long run because we see it clearly as an important business opportunity for us as well. So both go hand-in-hand. We closely look at metrics. And the metrics, we've been very focused on for the last couple of years. This is our third generation of hardware. It's the first time we actually are doing our products end-to-end, and we've expanded to newer categories. We look at user feedback and reception. We measure NPS scores. And our scores are now reflecting best-in-class in the category. And beyond that, we are looking at how the market adoption is, and we are thoughtfully building a business, but we are committed to building and investing for the long run.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And in terms of how we're thinking about planning, we're in the middle of it now. And many of the questions that have been already asked sort of point to the direction that we feel really good about the underlying strength in the Ads business. As we've talked about on numerous calls, we continue to invest here because we see ongoing opportunities, in particular, as we leverage machine learning to provide better experience for users and for advertisers. And some of the comments that Sundar made about the opportunities that open up with visual search, again, continue to point to the direction of direct response, continue to point to some of the underlying areas in which we're focused. But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it, and we continue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long term. Sundar has already commented on both hardware and Cloud as really important examples. And we think the steps that we're taking, the investments we're making, are -- provide kind of the foundational support for ongoing long-term, sustained growth. And so then we marry that with the second part of your question, which is on how do we think about the pace of investment. As we've said repeatedly, we're very focused on investing for the long term. We're trying to make sure that we prioritize crisply across the opportunity set that we have and we make the right types of trade-offs, but we do remain focused on long-term investing given the scale of the opportunities that we see.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two questions, please. One, Sundar, could you just update us with your thinking on China, the China market and the extent -- I know Google is already in that market, but the extent to which you want to expand -- reexpand your presence there with Search? And then in terms of Waymo, just a quick question. Commercialization of Waymo, do you know when -- do you have a sense of when you'll have pricing established and you'll have a roughly well-defined and action -- acted-on go-to-market strategy with Waymo? Is that the end of this year, beginning of next year, whenever?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And Mark on China, we obviously -- we deeply care about serving Chinese users. We've been investing for many years, and especially from developing Android. But more recently, we have launched mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go and improved our developer tools there. So we are constantly looking for ways by which we can better serve Chinese users. And that's where we are today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And then, in terms of Waymo, in the third quarter, as I think you know, we extended our Early Rider Program to a larger group, and we moved into very early days of commercialization. So we do now have people paying for rides, and we're also testing pricing models. I think the main point, we've said this repeatedly, is that we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience. And so what that means is we're really expanding the program methodically. We're taking an iterative approach as we continue to broaden the geographic footprint. And then on top of that, as we've talked about on prior calls, we've been developing the B2B opportunity. So in Phoenix, as an example, we've been piloting with several partners who are sponsoring a service on behalf of their employees and customers. And again, it's early days, so small revenues. But we're pleased to be testing this out as well and then, on top of that, continuing to explore, applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal use vehicles and for last-mile solutions for cities. So you can see a move in the third quarter. But as we said repeatedly, it's very early days, and we are taking a very deliberate, iterative approach to broadening it out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have 2. The first one on map monetization and putting some more ads in the map. Can you just talk about sort of early learnings there? I know you talked about local mobile searches growing quite rapidly in the past. But any early learnings from the monetization, the return that advertisers are getting on that front? And the second one on video games and Project Stream. Could you just talk a little about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet and what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and scale a direct-to-consumer-facing cloud gaming product?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Look, on the ad stuff, we've had ad formats in Maps for some time, and we are constantly working to make it more useful and relevant. But I wouldn't underestimate the focus we have on local. Just to give you a sense, local mobile searches are growing faster than just mobile searches overall and have increased by almost 50% in the last year. So for us, that's an important focus area, and Maps plays a big role there. So we recently announced local campaigns, which is a new campaign type specifically designed to drive foot traffic to local businesses, right? And it's going to roll out in the coming months. And so that is a big focus. And as you pointed out, we are definitely launching and experimenting with newer ad formats on Maps itself. We have promoted places, which appears on the map itself. Have placed page ads, which appear on Google listings in Maps and Search. But we are definitely in the phase of putting those, testing it out, making sure the user experience works and making sure we can deliver value for advertisers. We are being patient here because the opportunity in local search, it's a big opportunity, and we are focused there. On your second question, look, we today serve our users on gaming across Google Alphabet in many ways, right? Obviously, Google Play does this a lot. It's a big important vertical on YouTube. And so we are -- so we touch with gaming developers across many areas already. And so we are thoughtfully thinking about what more we can do there. And Project Stream, I -- having spent my life on computing, I was blown away by seeing our ability to stream a game which needs real-time interactions, and to be able to do that from the Cloud. And it's one of the most important technological advances I've seen in a while. And so we are going to focus on that and make sure we are making progress there and bring newer experiences for gamers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One for Sundar, one for Ruth. Sundar, can you help us better understand how the remedy in Europe will work in terms of licenses and TAC going forward? And what impact do you see that having on financials? And then Ruth, can you just talk about where you are in the hardware replacement cycle in your data centers? Pretty major step-up this year just given that large ramp. How are you thinking about the trajectory into '19?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Doug. On Europe, I mean, it's early to say. We'll begin on implementing the remedy in the next few weeks. But in all these cases, we always -- we're focused on complying with the commission's directive, and we want to make sure that the transition for both our users and our OEM partners is as smooth as possible. In this case, you're dealing with life cycles for mobile phones. So changes is going to take some time to reach users. And it's difficult to predict how the licensing model will be adopted. But our products are very popular with users across platforms. And so it's early to say, but we are focused on doing the right thing there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And then in terms of technical infrastructure and our CapEx. As we talked about last quarter, CapEx reflects our view of the growing opportunity set in our core Ads and Search businesses as well as the longer-term opportunities in newer businesses, in particular, to support Cloud and then very importantly, as we've talked about, machine learning across Alphabet. And we're particularly excited about the opportunity with machine learning because it opens up more services and products for users and for advertisers and for enterprise customers. And so given our view about the long-term potential with these opportunities, we're very focused on ensuring that we have the needed compute capacity to support growth. And that's what you're really seeing with the uptick in investment. To give you a bit of a breakdown, the largest component continues to be machines. But relative to last year, it's important to note that data center construction is an increasing percentage of our CapEx investment. And so we're now in various stages of developing more than 20 data center sites globally. We're also investing in network infrastructure, such as undersea cable, so we can deliver speed and quality. So again, this really goes to our view of the opportunity set. Having said, we do remain very focused on optimizing the use of CapEx and also on compute efficiency. We're very mindful of the fact that our decisions here on CapEx don't just result in CapEx spend, but also translate into higher depreciation expenses, and that goes both to cost of sales and OpEx. So very careful about how we're using it but want to make sure that we've built for the requirements that we have. And as much as you asked about technical infrastructure, just a quick note that our facility spend, namely real estate, was more muted this quarter, and it was primarily just the ongoing work on our ground-up development. So you're primarily seeing what's going on, on technical infrastructure here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Adam Sandler, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Equity Research & Senior Internet Analyst [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two questions, Ruth. So you guys posted pretty solid growth all around. But if we look at some of the international markets, each geography had a tougher comp and decelerated a little bit on a currency-neutral basis. So I guess, stepping back high level, the growth rates are solid. But can you give us any color on the overall macro picture here? I think we're getting mixed feedback from different companies across different sectors. So any high-level comments would be helpful on just the ad market, given that you're close to 20% of global advertising ex China. And then, Sundar, a question on, I guess, Pixel and just the overall advancement you're seeing in smartphone devices. So as you guys roll out more products like Lens and Gboard and some of these other utilities on top of your 1 billion-plus apps like Search and YouTube, is there any way to parse out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the U.S. and Western Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and you keep adding these additional utilities? Is core volume going up on a per-user basis? Any color there will be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So in terms of your first question, we actually felt pretty good about the strength globally, which I noted in the opening comments across the board, 20% growth in the U.S. on a $15 billion base. As Sundar noted what's going on in APAC, 30% year-on-year growth, it's now over a $5 billion revenue business, and we've had sustained quarter after quarter growth at this kind of 30%-ish area, feel really good about that. By country, it really does reflect broad-based strength. As you said, we're very focused on the region and we're delivering terrific products and experiences in rapidly growing markets. You see the same thing in Other Americas, neutralizing for currency movements, 28% year-on-year growth. So we're really proud of what the teams are doing around the globe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And on your second question, one of the things we clearly see when we make a hardware product like Pixel, in which all the tools and the utilities we build are conveniently there, integrated and the experience is great, we definitely see users engaging more. And so we see an opportunity. And that's one of the bigger reasons why we do hardware as well, to show that end-to-end experience, both for our ecosystem as well as for us. It helps us give users a much deeper engaged experience as well. And when you look at all our products, we see that. And so we do see that as an opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Brian Nathanson, MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have 2 for Sundar, kind of the same theme. One on the Pixel 3. The marketing message is clear. The product looks great. But I wonder when you look at to date, the success of ramping the product, what's been the gating factor? Has it been the carriers? Has it been the price? And when we look at the factors for why it hasn't scaled as much as the product should have scaled, what are the factors? And then on Verily, you called out some deals with kind of the big pharmaceutical companies this quarter. But again there, I wonder, who's your most natural partnership? Is it hospitals, insurance, governments? So when we think about the big opportunity, where's the most natural fit to drive Verily going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Pixel. Look, first of all, part of the big thing is this is our third generation of hardware. Each generation, first of all, we've been scaling up the product in terms of even the number of units we can make and so on. So we -- if you remember the first couple of generations, we were struggling to meet the early demand we saw. This is the first year we have done it end-to-end, and we are ramping up from there. And so each year, when I look at all the metrics, be it NPS or be it our sales, be it our revenues, et cetera, everything is progressing well. But there are -- you're right, the gating factors to ramp this up, first of all, is to be able to build the supply we need. And second is go-to-market, getting ourselves in as many locations in retail as possible, in as many countries as possible, with as many carrier certifications as possible. So in each of those dimensions, we are making progress as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In terms of Verily, what we've talked about there is they have partnered with a whole host of leading pharmaceutical companies focusing on specific diseases, whether it's diabetic retinopathy or across the board for neurological diseases. I announced a couple of new partnerships, the ResMed arrangement as well as Gilead. And that's what they tend to do. They partner with best-in-class to focus on specific areas where working with the pharmaceutical companies, they can -- and the technology we have and benefiting from machine learning, we can really move from reactive to proactive care. That's the Verily focus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Anne Bellini, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD & Analyst [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I just wanted to focus on Cloud a little bit more. Sundar, you gave some good color in your prepared remarks. But I'm wondering if you could share with us any update maybe on the partner momentum and direct sales momentum you're seeing in the market, how you've seen that change. And also if you can highlight, if you've noticed that there's been noticeable changes in win rates over the last year as the product continues to mature. And you also, in the beginning of the year and exiting Q4, you would give us some high-level growth commentary about GCP, and I'm just wondering if you have anything else you could share.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Heather. Look, overall, I mean, it's now -- now we've been doing this seriously, the next level, for 3 years. And we are definitely seeing strong indicators that are -- the investment in product is clearly beginning to work. Our value proposition does come through in many competitive situations. I've seen many important wins in what seem like very, very competitive situations. I also don't -- from the way we see it, it doesn't look like a zero-sum game. As you know, we're addressing a large market opportunity here. It seems like very early days. And more importantly, the general sense I get is we are very aligned with where the market is headed in the long run. And this notion of supporting open architecture so that enterprises don't feel locked in and allowing for a multi-cloud environment to develop, that's the direction we are betting on, and there are indications that the market is headed in that direction as well. So that gives us a lot of comfort -- that leaves us -- that gives us a lot of comfort as well. And on the go-to-market side, we have really ramped up both in terms of our investments, our direct investments, but also our partnership strategy is beginning to work. And when I look at the pipeline ahead, we are clearly seeing momentum there as well. In this business, obviously, the enterprise business plays in the way in which you do you have wins, but those accounts turn into larger revenue deals over time. And so it's very clear to us that we are laying the foundation, and we are getting the strong early momentum. And that's the big reason why we are investing in a strong way in the area. And over time, we'll obviously share more here as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Anne Bellini, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD & Analyst [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And can I just ask one follow-up, if possible? I was just wondering, if you look at Microsoft, they have an on-premise and Cloud strategy. If you look at Amazon, what they're doing with AWS and VMware, they're kind of doing a similar strategy. Do you think there's a requirement for you to also have an on-premise strategy to solve this hybrid world as long as it's hybrid for?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are thoughtfully looking at it. I mean, we are increasingly working with partners like, for example, our partnership from SAP or Pivotal, VMware. These are all on hybrid cloud solutions. And so we are thinking about how to do that better. And our overall approach to cloud hybrid modernization, I think, is the right long-term direction. And so we are doing that. There are many, many situations we are in where on-prem is a big requirement for customers. But with our partnership approach, we've been able to address the needs well. So I don't see that as gating issue for us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brent John Thill, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ruth, I just wanted to see if you could quantify the FX headwind. I think it was a negative 1% for Q3. And in Q4, do you anticipate that to be similar or a little worse?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will let you forecast the dollar. As you noted, it was a point here, went from a tailwind in the second quarter to a 1 point drag here going forward. But we called out the -- and we'll have more in the Q, but noted the impact, for example, of pretty big delta between our reported and fixed in Other Americas, 19% to 28% growth, and that was really what was going on with the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. We saw some movements in other currencies around the globe. But you can see that, which is why we broke out the geography, the way we've done it a number of quarters ago to try and give you -- help give a better sense of the types of headwinds, and I'll let you forecast the dollar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brent John Thill, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, we look forward to that. Real quick just on EMEA, you were flat on your constant currency growth, 19%, 19% the last 2 quarters despite with GDPR. So I believe that would suggest that you're probably not seeing as big a headwind, perhaps, as maybe some expected. Could you just talk to the European business and what you're seeing there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Look, I mean, specifically, I think your question is around GDPR and so on. First of all, I mean, we've always been, as a company, very, very focused on user privacy and security. And so in some ways, we were very early on engaged on GDPR. And we worked very hard to make sure our products are ready and in compliance. We've generally always approached our products with a strong privacy lens for our users. So -- and I think that helps us work through these changes because I don't think they are at odds with what we are trying to accomplish. I think GDPR is a very good and comprehensive set of regulations. And so I think it's been good to see a smooth transition on our products and for our users.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And we're continuing to invest significantly in Europe because we see the opportunity across Europe, and are investing in the communities in which we're working.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One quick one for Ruth. People are really asking about Amazon. Just wondering if your e-commerce vertical, was there any difference versus your other verticals in the quarter? Anything to call out there? And then, secondly, Sundar, a lot of interesting things going on with YouTube and Waymo and Cloud and other areas. As you look out 2 or 3 years, do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positive difference on the bottom line for overall Google?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai, Google LLC - CEO [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Look, I mean, I think on the first thing on e-commerce, maybe -- really, people -- we do see a lot of activity in the vertical on our products, and we see strong growth there as well. We see it as an important use case and that's why we are investing a lot. If you look at our recent work with Shopping Actions, that's an example of the kind of work we are doing there. And when we do those things, we clearly see users respond. Like, for example, on Shopping Actions, I think we just recently had partnerships with Best Buy and Nike and Sephora, I mentioned it earlier. So we are continuing to invest there, and we are also driving strong partnerships with the retail sector, both in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through Cloud. And I think that continues to be a big opportunity. And on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because, as a company, over the past 20 years, we have developed deep capabilities in technology, in computer science and especially with machine learning and AI. And we see an opportunity to apply that across a set of important areas. There are a lot of opportunities ahead of us. We are pretty disciplined about where we're focused on. And we are focused on real large opportunities. And when we mention areas like YouTube and Waymo and Cloud and hardware, they all fit that category. But we take a very long-term view. And we want to invest to get the user experience right. And we are pretty confident that when we do that, the value will follow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ellen West, Alphabet Inc. - VP of IR [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Welcome to Cisco Systems' second-quarter and FY17 financial results conference call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I'd like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora, Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Sam. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second-quarter FY17 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.
By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be available on our website in the investor relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our investor relations website.
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of FY17. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
As a reminder, in Q2 FY16 on November 20, 2015, we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business, and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q2 FY17. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call also has been normalized in the same way. With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck.

Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. We performed well this quarter, delivering total revenue of $11.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57. We drove strong profitability, healthy cash flow, and growth in deferred revenue, continuing our shift towards software and recurring revenue.
We also drove 51% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions, which now stands at $4 billion. We're also pleased that the Board approved a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.29.
We are delivering against our strategic priorities, offering unparalleled value to our customers, and we're executing and managing the Business to deliver greater shareholder return. Through a disciplined investment approach, we are focused on expanding our growth opportunities and strengthening our customer value proposition.
We were very pleased to announce our intent to acquire AppDynamics as a continuation of our strategy to provide customers with deep analytics across the data center, the network, as well as their applications. Increasingly, customers are seeing significant business value being delivered through applications and access through intelligent networks. Combining Cisco's infrastructure, networking, and security analytics with the application analytics from AppDynamics, we will provide customers with unprecedented insights to improve business performance.
The conversations I have every day with business and government leaders around the world reinforce the importance of our strategy. They look to Cisco to connect everything and everyone by building highly secure, software-defined, automated, and intelligent infrastructure platforms. We offer these solutions through a variety of consumption options, giving our customers choice and flexibility.
I would now like to cover some key business highlights, starting with our Security business. We had another great quarter in Security, which continued its strong momentum and growth. Revenue grew 14%, and deferred revenue grew 45%, reflecting the strength of our best-of-breed offerings and architectural approach to security from the network to the endpoint to the cloud.
Two weeks ago, we released the 10th annual Cisco cybersecurity report which highlights the increasing risk customers are facing around the world. Of the organizations we surveyed, over one-third of those who experienced a breach in 2016 reported substantial losses to their business. Customers are relying on Cisco's comprehensive portfolio of best-of-breach security products and services brought together in an integrated architectural approach to prevent and reduce the risk of business loss. As a proof point, deployments of our advanced threat solutions continue to be strong, as we added over 6,000 new customers, bringing the total to approximately 29,000 now using AMP, which led to revenue growth of 65% in the quarter.
Similar to our success in the advanced threat market, we added over 5,500 next-generation firewall customers, bringing our total customer base to 67,500. In addition to our leadership in network and advanced security, Cisco is leading the market in delivering innovative, cloud-based security solutions. Last week, we announced Cisco Umbrella, the industry's first secure Internet Gateway to address new enterprise security challenges in today's mobile and cloud world. Cisco Umbrella is designed to help users gain secure access to the Internet anywhere they go, even when they are off the enterprise network.
Now, let's turn to collaboration. This quarter, we saw strong customer growth across our collaboration portfolio, with revenue growing 4% and deferred revenue growing 14%. Further expanding our portfolio of subscription-based offerings, we introduced Cisco's Spark Board, the first all-in-one, cloud-based collaboration and meeting room solution. Cisco Spark Board enables screen sharing, interactive white-boarding, and video conferencing, and is complemented by a new version of our Cisco Spark application, a messaging and meeting platform for mobile and desktop endpoints. In the few weeks since launch, we have already had several hundred Cisco Spark Board customers who will be receiving ongoing innovation as part of the Cisco Spark subscription that they purchased together with the device.
We are seeing good customer momentum in our Data Center business, with customers choosing Cisco for the breadth of our private and hybrid cloud solutions. Across our next-generation data center portfolio, we saw healthy customer traction, including our ACI data center switching portfolio grew revenue by 28%. This includes 1,300 new Nexus 9000 customers and 450 new ACI customers in Q2, bringing the total install base to 10,800 and 3,100, respectively. We are the only company to offer end-to-end visibility and security for 100 gig network build-outs.
In our core business, the network has never been more relevant in a world of increasing connectivity driven by cloud, social, IoT, and digitization. Over the last year, we have been working hard on driving innovation in our core business, and we are starting to see some of the benefits, such as our wireless portfolio this quarter. We believe we are in the early stages of a product innovation cycle driven by security, automation, and analytics across the portfolio.
To further strengthen our cloud software and IoT portfolio, as I mentioned earlier, we announced our intent to acquire AppDynamics, a market leader in application intelligence whose solutions are helping the world's largest companies improve their application and business performance. Customers will now have unprecedented insight into their data center, security infrastructure, and networking performance through real-time application analytics in the cloud and on-premise. Approximately 75% of AppDynamics product revenue is subscription-based, which aligns well with the way customers increasingly want to consume technology and with Cisco's strategic objective of moving towards more recurring revenue.
The growing customer demand for real-time data is enabled by the increasing number of connected devices. We continue to build on the Jasper cloud IoT platform with new solutions. Today, Jasper connects more than 40 million devices, including over 12 million connected vehicles, and we are adding more than 1.5 million new devices per month. The number of enterprise customers utilizing data from the Jasper platform has grown from 4,000 a year ago to more than 9,000 this quarter.
In summary, we are confident in our strategy. We are delivering accelerated innovation across our portfolio. And we are pleased with the momentum across our businesses, and in our strategic shift towards recurring software- and subscription-based revenue. Now, let me hand it over to Kelly to walk through our Q2 results and outlook in more detail.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, great. Thanks, Chuck. So, I will start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter, followed by some comments about our capital allocation and the Q3 outlook.
Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter, with revenue of $11.6 billion, down 2%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, flat year over year. We continued to make progress on our strategic growth priorities, while maintaining rigorous discipline on profitability and cash generation. As part of our strategy to drive long-term profitable growth, we are prioritizing key investments, both organically and inorganically, such as the intended acquisition of AppDynamics.
Today, our Board approved an increase of $0.03 to the quarterly dividend, bringing it to $0.29 per share, a 12% increase, representing a yield of approximately 3.5% on today's closing price. We remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy and returning value to our shareholders.
Let me provide some more details on our revenue breakdown. Total product revenue was down 4%, and let me walk through each of the product areas. Switching declined 5%, driven by weakness in Campus, partially offset by strength in the ACI portfolio, which was up 28%. Routing was down 10%, although we did see growth in orders. Collaboration grew 4%, driven by ongoing solid performance of WebEx, Unified Communications, and TelePresence. We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions in SaaS offers with deferred revenue growing 14%.
Data Center declined 4%, impacted by the continued market shift from blade to rack, though last week we announced expansion of our UCS portfolio by offering the Microsoft Azure stack on UCS via an integrated validated system that enables organizations to deliver Microsoft Azure services from their on-premise data centers. The joint Cisco and Microsoft solution provides the tools for enterprises to grow and modernize their applications in a highly flexible and scalable hybrid cloud environment.
Wireless grew 3%, with ongoing strength in Meraki and the continued ramp of our 11ac Wave 2 portfolio. Security grew 14%, with deferred revenue growth of 45%, as we offer more solutions to customers with increasing software content that results in greater recurring revenue. We had very strong performance in our advanced threat security of 65%, as well as strength in unified threat management and web security solutions. Our focus continues to be developing a best-of-breed portfolio, while offering customers the benefit of deep architectural integration spanning the network cloud endpoint, which we believe is outpacing our competitors. Services continues to execute well, growing 5%, with a strong focus on renewals and attach rates.
Overall, we drove13% growth in total deferred revenue, with product up 19% and services up 9%. We continued to build our product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription businesses to $4 billion, up 51%. We made good progress on increasing our recurring revenue, with 31% of our total Q2 revenue generated from recurring offers, up from 28% a year ago. In terms of orders, total product orders growth was flat, with book-to-bill greater than 1.
Let's take a look at our geographies, which is the primary way we run the Business. We are seeing continued strength in the Americas, which grew 4%. EMEA was down 4%, and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets declined 7%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 5%. In terms of customer segments, enterprise grew 1%, commercial grew 3%, public sector was down 6%, and service provider declined 1%.
From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total gross margin was 64.1%, down slightly by 0.1 points. Our product gross margin was 62.4%, down 0.9 points, and service gross margin was 68.8%, growing 2.1 points. Operating margin was solid at 31%. We are maintaining our discipline and driving productivity with an ongoing focus of cost improvements and operational efficiencies, making the necessary trade-off to drive operating margin.
At the bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 and GAAP EPS of $0.47. We delivered operating cash flow of $3.8 billion, and ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $71.8 billion, with $9.6 billion available in the US. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter, that included $1 billion for share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend.
To summarize, we had solid performance in Q2 and managed the Business well. We're making the investments we need to deliver shareholder value over the long term, and we are being very disciplined in driving continuous cost efficiencies.
Let me now reiterate our guidance for the third quarter. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. As a reminder, the third quarter of last year included an extra week, which resulted in higher revenue of $265 million, and higher non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses of $150 million, netting into $115 million of non-GAAP operating income.
The guidance for the third quarter is as follows. We expect revenue in the range of minus 2% to 0% year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. The non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.57 to $0.59. My guidance does not reflect any impact from AppDynamics. I'll now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Kelly. Once again, we had a solid quarter, and I am pleased with how we're executing against our strategy. Let me summarize why I am confident in our ability to bring even greater value to our customers, partners, and shareholders. First, we delivered strong innovation in key areas such as security, collaboration, and next-generation data center, as we continue to also drive innovation in our core. Second, we have strong momentum in our transition, as seen with 51% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions, as we continue to add more software offers like you see with Cisco Spark Board. Third, profitable growth: We continue to stay focused on driving productivity and operational efficiencies. Lastly, we remain committed to increasing shareholder return, as you've seen with our dividend increase of 12%.
Our customers have never cared more about what technology can do for their business. They are looking for speed, agility, visibility, and security in everything that they do. Cisco is uniquely qualified to meet these demands with our ability to drive automation analytics with intelligence and security, all the way from the network to the application. And that's why I am confident in our future. Marilyn, now I'll turn it back to you for questions.

Pierre Ferragu, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was trying to understand where we stand in the weakness you saw when you talked about three months ago. If I look at your guide, it's very encouraging. It shows that you were getting back to a sequential growth that is better than slightly above what you have done on average in recent years. And then, if I hear your comments, Campus was very weak in the quarter. Routing as well. And, you see orders coming back in routing. My question would be whether you see something similar in Campus? Can we expect that part of the business to improve in coming months and coming quarters? And then, maybe just more broadly, what's your feeling about the macro today? The uncertainty and the weakness in orders you could see three months ago, is this something that is improving now, already?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Pierre. Let me just start, and then, Kelly, you can add whatever you like here. I think as it relates to our core portfolio, we have seen, obviously, some macro dynamics. Europe is clearly stressed with all the geopolitical dynamics that are occurring in Europe right now across several countries. And we also have begun to invest pretty significantly over the last year, and you'll see it over the coming year, in ensuring we had the appropriate investments in innovation in our core. But, you also see what we did with AppDynamics, and what I would tell you is that when you combine the analytics that we can deliver out of the data center with the analytics that we will deliver out of the core networking space with our security threat information and analytics out of our security portfolio combined with the application analytics that they have, we believe that we can create a differentiated architecture for our customers going forward. And, that's what we are -- that's the purpose in the acquisition and what we intend to do going forward. So, Kelly, any other comments on the macro and the sequentials?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. I think just to add to that, I think, we do feel good about what we're seeing from macro in the US certainly and in commercial and enterprise. And, I would say to your point, Pierre, when you do adjust for that extra week last year, we are -- our guide -- we always call it like we see it, and it does show a bit of improvement there on both the top line and bottom line. So, I think like Chuck said, I think that the US is solid, and again, we're still cautious on outside the US and Europe and Asia.

Unidentified Participant, - Analyst [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Justin on for Jim Suva. Thanks, Chuck and Kelly, for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on your partnership with Ericsson? I know recently you've had a couple of different rollouts and then some good press releases in terms of what you are doing. I'm just wondering if you could maybe provide any updates or any milestones now that it's been about a year since you've had the partnership going? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think it was Justin, right? Justin, thanks for the question. It's pretty timely. In fact, we -- obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty on the Ericsson side, and we believe that all the original business drivers that led us to establish the partnership with Ericsson are still very valid. I think we have had some 300 customer engagements together, and their new CEO came on board just about five weeks ago, I believe. And, we have been in a great deal of discussion since then on ways in which we could accelerate the partnership. He is committed to continuing and trying to make this as successful as we possibly can. We're going to meet again in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress, and I would say we're focused right now on how do we accelerate from here.

Paul Silverstein, Cowen and Company - Analyst [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I could ask for a quick clarification and then a question. Kelly, I think last quarter you quantified the impact of the shift in the business model is over 2 percentage points in terms of the hit to growth as you increase your future visibility on the shift. Can you update -- I don't think I heard you give an update this quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think what I say is between 1% and 2%. So, we are in that 1.5% to 2% range.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Silverstein, Cowen and Company - Analyst [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, and would that be your expectation on an ongoing basis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Again, as we continue to accelerate the growth -- as we're continuing to grow it like we have been growing -- I referred it. It may get even more until it evens out, but in the last few quarters, it has been in that range.

Mitch Steves, RBC Capital Markets - Analyst [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for taking my question. I want to circle back on the security piece. You have given out advanced threat numbers in the past and the breakdown there. So, how does the margin structure change as you grow the advanced threat and the web security piece versus the legacy security portfolio that you've had?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We don't share gross margins by businesses, but I can tell you the margins are growing in our security portfolio overall between the mix of the growth in these areas and the acquisitions of the SaaS businesses we've been adding. So, it's very accretive to the Cisco average.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitch Steves, RBC Capital Markets - Analyst [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just one quick, small follow-up. Just on a repatriation potential, are you leaning more towards essentially M&A or buybacks or a dividend because you have raised it by 12% now. Just wondering how you think about that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mitch, first priority will be strategic investments that we will make, and then, obviously, followed with a focus on continued capital allocation and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. It would be a combination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. One of the big themes with some of the other folks across the [com] landscape is web scale. That wasn't a major theme of the opening script. I am hoping that you could help us understand your positioning in web scale. Certainly in switching where the competition is heightened and also in routing and even DCI. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Jeff. So, as we look at MSDC what we've given you over the last few quarters is a very fixed list of 10 customers that we have given. And, I have said over and over that we have been spending a lot of time with these customers, really focused on understanding what their unique needs are. Frankly, some of them are so big they are a market of one unto themselves, and I'm very pleased with the progress we're making. If you look at those 10 just to give you the numbers this time. Overall, those 10 would be down, but if you normalize out one of those providers and you take the combination of the other nine, and that one had some pretty tough year-over-year comps. The other nine were up double digits, and we have one of the largest that was up triple digits for the second quarter in a row. So, I feel like we are making good progress, but we still have a long way to go.

Thanks. Chuck, appreciate the opportunity. I guess I'm going to sound like a broken record and ask the same question I've asked over four or five quarters now which is your data center revenue. Your server business which has again continued to stay in range. Not showing much progress. How do you feel about the progress that you are making over there with hyperconverged? It just doesn't seem to be moving the dial [be it]? How do you resolve the issues in this business going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Ittai. We can always count on you for that question. (laughter) First of all, I think in our next-gen data center switching portfolio, you can see continued performance and continued good adoption of those solutions from our customer base. I think on the hyperconverged, we certainly would like to see it moving more quickly. We have recently had a release of software that has helped with some of the capabilities, and I think that there are a couple more coming that should continue to give us more capabilities in that space. I think that we are also looking, as you would expect, at our broad strategy in the data center and where we need to go to ensure that we best position ourselves going forward. So, that work is going on as well right now, Ittai.

Thanks. Hi Chuck, Kelly. I'd like to get bigger picture thoughts, Chuck and Kelly, on how you plan to broaden your senior management team? Any new areas or skill sets you will be looking for in the management team to drive profit and growth through the rest of this year and over the next few years? And, is the strategy focused primarily on doubling down on security, analytics, AI, automation?

Okay. Chuck, my question was more on the senior management team. Any new skill sets, any new areas or avenues you will be looking for to round out the management team to drive top line growth? Or, will you primarily be doubling down on security, analytics, AI? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's a great question. I think that when you look at the improvement we've been making around our transition to software and subscription business, you can assume that we will continue to look for people who have those kinds of capabilities. And, if you look at even the AppDynamics acquisition, David Wadhwani, who is their CEO, was one of the key drivers behind the software transition that occurred at Adobe so he very much understands how this transition will occur. You can assume that we are adding talent in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, software skills around simplicity and automation. As you know if you look at our core, one of the biggest things are customers are looking for is to take out the cost of operating this infrastructure. And so, as we build out automation capabilities that allow them to very dynamically change their environments as opposed to the manual way it has been done in the past -- those skill sets as well. So, it's a combination of all those in addition to security and all the other areas you mentioned. So, it's broad-based.

Steve Milunovich, UBS Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steve Milunovich, UBS - Analyst [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you. Kelly, you mentioned the percentage of recurrent revenues, 31%. If you exclude services, are we still around 9% to 10% of product revenue being recurring? And, is there any way to turn that core routing switching business into something more recurring? We've never seen a hardware Company do that, if you will. But, through ELAs or something else, is there any way to turn that into little more of a subscription -- consistent basis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's a great question, Steve. So, actually, product as a percentage of my total product revenue -- it is up to 10% now this quarter for the first time. So, we're happy about that. And, we are trying to make that shift in the core part of the business. Cisco 1 is an example of where we are taking our ELAs and our big cross-enterprise ELAs that really are our core networking business to do that. So, we're trying to find ways to find other offers.
I will just point to another example though like the Spark Board that Chuck mentioned. It's a great new innovation and extension of TelePresence, but it's a great example of where we are selling that -- we used to sell it always as a system, now we're selling the equipment. But, we are selling it with a subscription. So, that's an example of how we have been able to drive new offers that had been traditionally just pure system or hardware. And, again, the teams are driving hard to find more ways to accelerate new offers that way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steve, I want to just make a couple comments on this. One, if you look -- six quarters ago when I came into the job, our overall revenue -- our recurring revenue was 26%. In the first four quarters, we spent time taking our teams and helping our teams understand the transition that we were going to make. So, in the first four quarters, we gained 2 points. We took it up to 28%, and in the last two quarters, we've added 3 points. So, we've accelerated it. It has gone to 31% in the last two quarters. And, on the product side, that went from 6% to 7% in the first year, and then in the last two quarters, it's gone from 7% to 10%. I think we are finding ways to move that forward.
As it relates to the core, I think you'll see us come out with services around automation and analytics and other things that will be sold as subscriptions on top of the platforms. And, the last thing I will tell you is that we pulled some of -- one of the key leaders from the security portfolio who had really driven the whole product management portion of that transition to the heavy content of software and subscription that you see today, and he is now leading that for us in our core networking space in the enterprise networking. So, it's clearly a focus that he is trying to drive for us.

Thanks. Good afternoon. Just following up on the cash repatriation M&A question, Chuck. Just want to get a sense going forward, should we think about a continuation of more of the string of pearls approach similar to AppDynamics? Or, can you make more sizable acquisitions? And then, Kelly, I wanted to get a sense if you could help us understand how we should think about deferred revenue, clearly growing nicely. What is the feedback loop 1 year, 1.5 years out from now in terms of does gross margin start to trend higher because of the deferred revenue mix is becoming [richer] in configuration? Thank you.

Mark, first off, I'll take the repatriation and the M&A question, and Kelly, you can take the next one. So, you are free to make comments on mine as well. (laughter) I think our M&A strategy is going to remain intact. Repatriation doesn't fundamentally change how we think about what we're going to do going forward. You can assume that we will continue to look for opportunities to drive the business value and the relevance to our customers like we did with AppD. They have a tremendous platform that really translates application analytics to real business performance information for our customers.
And, just to comment on AppDynamics, they have a very robust enterprise solution that is delivered either from the cloud or on-premise and can be delivered to the customer on-premise or in the cloud. So, it's very flexible. And, they basically have 275 of the Fortune 2000, and they really have never had a substantial partner model. Those are the reasons we think that makes a lot of sense. So, strategic alignment and the ability for us to take it through our ecosystem are always positive. Kelly, comments on the deferred and the margins?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the deferred, Mark, that is part of why we're trying to make this shift to software. Our customers want those offers and to have an easier way to run their IT departments. It clearly enables us to get higher margins, for sure. And, it's not only just the gross margins coming out of deferred revenue, but we are looking at our whole end-to-end operations and how we go to market, how we drive operations in the back end here. And, there is really opportunities to drive both gross margins and operating margins. So, that's why we are so focused on it. That's why we are looking at acquisitions to add to it, and it will continue to help improve our mix on the margins line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora, Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR [50]

Thanks, Chuck and Kelly. Sam, let's go ahead and take the next question.

James Faucette, Morgan Stanley.

Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about product gross margins. They were a bit weaker than we had at least modeled, and I think in the 8-K, there's some indication that there was some pricing. But, I would like some more color there. Particularly, one thing that we noticed that the APAC margins were look particularly weak. Is this related to customer, geography? Just a little help on understanding where the pressures are on [product gross] margin?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, I will take that one and a great question. Gross margins, we have been -- again, continue to operate well. I will say there were two specific headwinds that we faced this quarter. And, to your point on APJC, I will refer back to a year ago we were benefiting from a national program in China where they were rolling out set-top boxes to tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Not our set-top boxes, but we were providing the smart cards to go with that which were -- they are basically for secure access, and it was very, very high margin. So, we had if you go back a year ago, SP Video in Asia was extremely strong because of that. That program has dramatically slowed down. And, again, that pure margin just isn't there any more, and you are seeing that flow through both the margins and the year-over-year revenues for both SP Video and APJC.
The other item that's a headwind for us this quarter is we are facing a significant cost increase to our memory costs -- our DRAM memory costs that we are paying. It's a very tight supply right now. And, we are seeing dramatic increases there. So, that's hurting us quite a bit as well. But, other than that, I would say the color is in the same line. Our pricing is in the ranges that we have been the last six to eight quarters. I'd say a little on the higher end, but in line with where we were Q3, Q4. A little worse than last quarter, but we were very low last quarter. So, in the normal ranges. It really those two specific things. I will say that I do anticipate those two headwinds to remain there next quarter as well as we had very strong SP Video -- that China program in Q3 as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora, Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR [54]

Let's go ahead and take the next question, Sam.

Jess Lubert, Wells Fargo Securities.

Jess Lubert, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice quarter. First, just had a clarification. There were a number of articles regarding a faulty clocking component over the last few weeks. Just wanted to see if you could comment to what degree that is or isn't impacting customer activities? And then, the question -- I was hoping you might be able to update us in a little greater detail regarding the trends you're seeing in the service provider vertical? You mentioned some encouraging order development? So, was hoping you could help us understand what you are seeing across geographies? What you are seeing from a product perspective? And, to what degree that improvement is coming from routing optical security or some other part of the service provider business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. I will start on the supplier component issue. So, yes, those articles are out there. We have had an issue from a supplier come out. And, we did book a reserve for $125 million you can see in our GAAP results and in the press release to cover that. We always and continue to stand by our customers through any situations like this. This is very proactive. This is a failure rate that will happen over time, but we are working with our customers to work through that so we're not anticipating any impact from that from a top line perspective.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will take the SP portion, Kelly. So, Jess, on the service provider space, it's really similar to last time. We talked about SP CapEx -- different service providers are looking at different areas of investment depending on what's going on in their network. So, you have some who are looking at macro radio densification as an example, and others are looking at building out capacity in the quarter. And so, we have -- and it's a segment that is very dominated by large customers.
So, from a quarter-to-quarter basis, any number of customers that make any shift in their buying behavior can have an impact either positively or negatively. It's a space that I will just encourage you to look at longer term, but we did see -- we saw a definite improvement. We saw -- I would say from a regional perspective what I would tell you is the Americas was very strong. And, we saw general weakness in Europe and then the China space you had a lot of this SP Video implication that Kelly was talking about earlier. So, overall, I think the teams did a great job. We have -- I think the teams are working incredibly well on the next generation of capabilities in the platforms and in some of the software and automation and some of the same themes that we've been talking about in the enterprise core networks. I feel good about where they are right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora, Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for the question, Jess. We'll go ahead and take the next question, Sam.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simon Leopold, Raymond James.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simon Leopold, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. - Analyst [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. Thank you for taking my question here. I wanted a little bit of hand-holding and help with interpreting this deferred revenue growth. 51%, obviously, a very big number. Looking at the balance sheet, it looks like it rose year-over-year by about $1.9 billion, and you talked about the total of software and recurring revenue at $4 billion. Could you help us get a better understanding of what are the components? And, I'm presuming there are some elements that maybe are growing much slower, some growing faster. So, help us understand what are the big drivers for that 51% growth. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. So, that 51% growth is year-over-year growth of over $1.3 billion. And, everything is growing in that space. I would say from a pure size, collaboration and security and Meraki are the biggest pieces of that because they have just continued to grow their businesses significantly, and they are all growing huge double digits. But, I will also say my switching and my routing as well as data center, we've done fiscal one bundles as well as big enterprise license agreements. They've also been growing huge double digits as well. So, at the end of the day, the year-over-year increases across the board, everything is up massively to drive to that 51%. And, again, just the biggest chunk of it between collaboration, security, and wireless, they are two-thirds I would say of the balance but the other pieces -- .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wireless being Meraki.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wireless being Meraki, yes. Hopefully, that gives you the color you are looking for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora, Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All right. Thanks, Kelly. Sam, let's go ahead and take that next question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jayson Noland, Robert Baird. Okay, great. Thank you. Kelly, just to clarify. There is no expectation of revenue or earnings impact from this clock issue in the current quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jayson Noland, Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc. - Analyst [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not as of right now. Again, we're working very proactively with our customers in terms of how quickly and where they want to do their replacement. So, we're working very, very closely. But, as of right now, we have not seen and don't anticipate any massive revenue impact from this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora, Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All right. Thank you. That was our last question for today. I'm going to turn it over to Chuck for some closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just a couple of comments, and first of all, I want to just thank you all again for joining us today. We did deliver strong innovation, I believe, which was reflective in the performance that we've had in security collaboration, next-gen data center, and we continue to drive innovation in our core enterprise and SP portfolio. The deferred revenue from our subscription and software business is indicative, I think, of the transition that you should continue to expect from us. We will continue to focus on driving profitable growth with productivity and operational efficiencies, and you also can count on the fact that we remain very committed to our shareholder return as was indicated in both our buybacks and our dividend, and then, the increase in the dividend this quarter. So, I just want to thank all of you for being with us today. And then, Marilyn, I will let you take it from here. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora, Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect all our FY17 third quarter results will be on Wednesday, May 17, 2017 at 1.30 PM Pacific time, 4.30 PM Eastern time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out and contact the Cisco investor relations group, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.

With that, let me hand it over to Bob.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Trey, and thank you all for joining our call. Amid a very challenging environment, cloud and network infrastructure and PC capabilities have been vital in allowing businesses and people to continue to work, learn, stay connected and provide critical goods and services. Those trends contributed to a very strong quarter in which we generated $19.7 billion in revenue and delivered $1.23 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $1.2 billion on the top line and $0.13 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and drove approximately 52% of the company's revenue, and our PC-centric businesses grew 7%.
I continue to be amazed by our employees and supply chain partners who have diligently worked to keep our business operating at a high level during this unprecedented challenge. COVID-19 has driven redesigned workflows and added additional environmental stress that I know has strained employees and ecosystem partners as they try to maintain productivity in this new world. I want to thank our employees and partners for their incredible contributions. Our primary focus continues to be ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce, delivering for our customers and helping the communities in which we operate.
On each earnings call, I give updates about our progress against 3 key priorities: accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Let me give you a few thoughts on each.
We're transforming the company to accelerate growth. That means not just playing defense but position our business to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We've built scale businesses indexed to key technology inflections such as cloud, AI, 5G and the intelligent and autonomous edge. We see a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals, our factories and now even our schools. In this new world, our opportunity set becomes more than just the CPU. It's more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so we can have a larger impact on our customers' success. That diversity is one critical factor in driving today's results.
I'll highlight a few examples from the last 90 days. AI use cases are becoming pervasive, and we are embedding AI capability into all our products. Our Xeon platform is foundational for data center AI with value, scalability, built-in AI acceleration and inference leadership. This quarter, we launched our third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Cooper Lake, which is the first mainstream server CPU, bfloat16 support, which increases AI throughput by reducing the amount of data required for the same accuracy. Developers can use and test latest Intel optimized versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch to train their models using bfloat16 and the Intel distribution of OpenVINO to deploy optimized inference from cloud to edge.
In Q2, both our cloud and comms service provider businesses grew more than 40% year-over-year as critical cloud-delivered applications continued to scale and 5G build-outs accelerated. Leading cloud service providers, including Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook and Tencent, announced they are adopting our third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors into their infrastructure and services.
Also this quarter, Azure introduced several new Xeon Scalable instances, including general purpose and memory optimized Azure virtual machines. We were also excited to be part of an industry first with Rakuten's full-scale commercial launch of its mobile carrier service. This service is the world's first end-to-end, fully virtualized, cloud native mobile network, and it's powered by Intel processors and FPGAs from the radio access network to the 5G-ready mobile core.
Compute capabilities are moving from the cloud to the edge and catalyzing a vast array of new usages and market opportunities. The largest opportunity we see at the edge is the $230 billion 2030 TAM for ADAS, data and Mobility-as-a-Service technologies. Since the last call, we acquired Moovit, a leading Mobility-as-a-Service solution company. Combining Mobileye's market-leading ADAS and AD technologies with Moovit accelerates our ability to become a full-stack mobility provider and truly revolutionize transportation. The most important demonstration of the power of our technologies is the commitment of our customers, and we are excited this week to announce a significant design win with Ford. Design win to date in 2020 include multiple new ADAS production programs, representing cumulative volume of over 20 million units.
We're also driving incredible innovation for our customers across a wide spectrum of PC use cases. This quarter, we introduced 3 new additions to our 10th gen processor family, extending our leadership in gaming and business. The Core S- and H-series processors for desktop and mobile gaming deliver speeds out of the box reaching up to 5.3 gigahertz, making them the world's fastest gaming processors; and our new 10th-gen Intel Core vPRO processors deliver uncompromised productivity and hardware-based security for commercial PCs. Q2 also marked the launch of Lakefield, featuring our new Intel hybrid technology, which is a hybrid CPU architecture for power and performance scalability.
We also continue to work on improving our execution. Intel employees and our supply chain partners have role modeled teamwork in navigating difficult conditions while working to support customer upsides during the crisis. We have made significant progress in increasing our capacity and improving our supply while delivering $2 billion above our plans through the first 6 months of the year. We're on track to return to more normal levels of PC inventory as we work through the second half of the year.
Acceleration of our next-generation products continues. We now expect to increase our 10-nanometer-based product shipments for the year by more than 20% versus our January expectations. Customer demand for our family of 10-nanometer-based SoCs for 5G base station designs is also very strong. We delivered a full node of performance improvement within our 14-nanometer-based products by optimizing our product and process together, and the power of our intra-node improvements continues with our next-generation 10-nanometer-based client product, Tiger Lake.
Tiger Lake delivers breakthrough performance in CPU, graphics and AI, and we'll be shipping to customers in a matter of weeks. We are also targeting initial production shipments for our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake, for the end of the year. And we have a pipeline of exciting new product architectures for 2021 led by Alder Lake for client and Sapphire Rapids for server. Both products will start initial production shipments in the second half of '21.
Let me provide some updates on our technology road map. We continue to demonstrate proof points of our breakthrough advanced packaging technologies. Our Lakefield product, which I mentioned earlier, delivers scale production of our 3D packaging technology, Foveros, combining both 10-nanometer and 22-nanometer capabilities in a disaggregated architecture.
This quarter also marked a significant milestone in our data center GPU technology. We successfully powered a petaflop scale GPU with high bandwidth memory, using our advanced embedded multi-die interconnect bridge, or EMIB, 2D packaging technology.
Turning to our 7-nanometer technology. We are seeing an approximate 6-month shift in our 7-nanometer-based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7-nanometer process, which, based on recent data, is now trending approximately 12 months behind our internal target. We have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation. We've root caused the issue, and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks. But we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty. We're mitigating the impact of the process delay on our product schedules by leveraging improvements in design methodology such as die disaggregation and advanced packaging. We have learned from the challenges in our 10-nanometer transition and have a milestone-driven approach to ensure our product competitiveness is not impacted by our process technology road map.
Our overarching priority is to deliver product leadership for our customers, and we are taking the right steps to produce a strong lineup of leadership products. We will continue to invest in our future process technology road map, but we will be pragmatic and objective in deploying the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be on our process, external foundry process or a combination of both.
Our advanced packaging technologies, combined with our disaggregated architecture, give us tremendous flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, our data center GPU design, Ponte Vecchio, will now be released in late 2021 or early 2022, utilizing external and internal process technologies, combined with our world-leading packaging technologies. We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer product, a client CPU, in late '22 or early '23. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process road map, including the holiday refresh window of 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer data center CPU design in the first half of '23.
Finally, while process technology is very important, it is only one of the 6 technology pillars of innovation that drive differentiation in our products. You will hear more about advances across all 6 technology pillars: process, packaging, architecture, memory, interconnect and security/software at the upcoming Intel Architecture Day.
Last, we are focused on the thoughtful allocation of your capital. We are investing to grow our capabilities even as we deliver significant free cash flow this year. Since 2015, we have grown R&D spending by more than $1 billion while divesting noncore assets and reducing overall spending as a percentage of revenue by 9 points. We also look for opportunities to augment our product lines and speed the pace at which we can grow the company. As discussed earlier, we acquired Moovit this quarter, investing approximately $900 million to dramatically accelerate our capability to capitalize on the $160 billion Mobility-as-a-Service opportunity. We also announced a $250 million investment in Jio Platforms, a high-speed wireless connectivity and digital services provider, to help fuel digital transformation in India.
Our purpose to deliver world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on Earth has never been more essential, but the global problems we face are bigger than any one company can solve alone. That's why we established 2030 corporate responsibility goals, which call for a collective response to revolutionize health and safety, make technology fully inclusive and help address climate change. We've also committed more than $50 million and extended our expertise, global reach and influence to combat COVID-19 as well as social injustice. The early results of our pandemic response technology initiative, which we announced earlier this week, underscore Intel's unique ability to partner and collectively solve critical problems.
In closing, I want to thank all our employees who are working through this challenging time to deliver our purpose and support our customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. The atypical seasonal effects of COVID-related demand for mobility products and data center infrastructure continued in Q2, resulting in record Q2 revenue for CCG, DCG and memory. Revenue came in at $19.7 billion, up 20% year-on-year, and $1.2 billion higher than guide. Data-centric revenue of $10.2 billion, up 34% year-on-year, represented 52% of our total revenue, an all-time high. Strong demand for NAND and 5G networking solutions and richer server mix drove most of the upside versus our expectations. Q2 PC-centric revenue was $9.5 billion, up 7% year-on-year on strong notebook PC sales enabled through increased manufacturing supply on capacity additions over the past year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 55%, slightly below expectations, on higher product costs from faster uptake of our 5G ASIC products, which are margin dilutive relative to the company average, and also continued acceleration of 10-nanometer products overall, partially offset by a shift of costs from cost of sales to R&D related to 7-nanometer product timing. As a reminder, we expected an approximate 3-point reduction in gross margin in the second quarter on the effect of pre-PRQ reserves for our Tiger Lake client product. This is largely a timing item with respect to the full year as we benefit from the $0 units in our initial sales of product, which will begin this quarter.
Operating margin of 31% in the quarter was approximately flat versus last year as spending efficiency offset lower gross margin. Q2 EPS was $1.23, $0.13 above our guide as stronger-than-expected operating results from notebook, memory and a richer mix of server products, along with higher gains in our trading asset portfolios, offset increased costs from our 10-nanometer acceleration and the effects of a discrete foreign tax item.
In Q2, we generated $11.2 billion in operating cash flow and invested $3.4 billion in CapEx, with $7.7 billion of free cash flow up 92% year-over-year. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders via dividends. As a reminder, we paused our share repurchase program in Q1 as we felt it was prudent to do so in the current economic environment. We expect to complete the balance of our $20 billion share repurchase program and return to our historical capital return practices when market dynamics stabilize.
Moving to segment performance in Q2. Data Center Group revenue of $7.1 billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectations, with strength across our customer segments. Year-over-year platform volumes and ASPs were up 29% and 5%, respectively. DCG adjacencies also delivered significant growth with revenue up 118% year-on-year on strong adoption of 5G networking solutions.
While year-over-year comparisons for DCG benefited from a weaker Q2 '19, revenue in the quarter came in at the second highest level ever for DCG and the highest revenue ever in our cloud business. Revenue year-over-year was up 47% in cloud, 34% in enterprise and government and 44% for communications service providers. Operating margin was 44%, up 8% year-on-year on higher revenue and high-end compute mix. We see increased competition this year, but we've also seen strong customer response to our product portfolio and now expect to end the year with market share that is somewhat higher than our original expectations.
Our other data-centric businesses were up 14% year-over-year, primarily on the NAND dynamics in Q2, despite significant COVID headwinds impacting demand in our more GDP-sensitive businesses, IOTG and Mobileye. IOTG revenue and operating income declined 32% and 76%, respectively, primarily on lower revenue from industrial, retail and vision segments. Mobileye revenue was down 27%, and operating income turned to a modest loss as the decline in global auto sales more than offset continued ADAS penetration and new IQ program launches.
NSG's record quarterly revenue of approximately $1.7 billion was up 76% year-on-year on strong NAND bit growth and improved pricing. Q2 was an all-time record for quarterly revenue for our memory business. The business also returned to profitability this quarter, generating approximately $300 million in operating income.
PSG revenue grew 2% year-over-year on cloud strength, which was partially offset by weaker demand from embedded and communications segments. Operating income was up 54% on richer product mix and improved unit cost.
CCG revenue was $9.5 billion in Q2, up 7% year-over-year, driven by notebook demand and higher modem and WiFi sales, which more than offset lower desktop volumes. PC unit volumes were up 2% year-over-year on higher notebook demand and increased supply. We expect our share to improve throughout the remainder of the year as we begin to recover unit share in notebooks, utilizing our smaller core products which we have not been able to fully serve given the strength of demand for our large core products.
Operating margin was 30%, down 12 points year-on-year as higher unit costs associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products and the pre-PRQ reserves ahead of our Q3 Tiger Lake launch more than offset the benefits of higher revenue.
Moving now to our third quarter outlook. Based on demand signals from our customers, we expect continued strength in cloud and comms infrastructure and consumer notebook PCs in Q3, but we expect that the weak economic environment will impact our commercial PC business, particularly the desktop form factor, and also drive lower demand for the enterprise and government segment in DCG and in IOTG and Mobileye. As a result, we expect total revenue of $18.2 billion, with PC-centric and data-centric businesses down mid-single digits year-over-year.
In Q3, we expect the PC TAM to be down high single digits year-over-year on OEM inventory drawdown, softer desktop demand and the effects of the global recession. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%, down 3.5 points year-over-year as the accelerated ramp of 10-nanometer products and lower platform revenue more than offset NAND margin improvement.
We are expecting a tax rate of approximately 15.5% in Q3. This is approximately 2 to 2.5 points above our previous expectations, primarily due to a lower FDII benefit in the year, a temporary reduction in R&D tax credits in California and the effect of a pushout of a foreign grant. The higher tax rate is reducing our EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.03 versus our prior rate expectations. As a result, Q3 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share.
Moving to full year. We are providing full year guidance, although visibility remains somewhat limited into the fourth quarter. Still, we do expect some part of the company's first half outperformance will be additive to our estimate for full year revenue. We are now forecasting revenue of $75 billion and EPS of approximately $4.85. We expect our PC-centric business to be flat to slightly down against the PC TAM that is down mid-single digits year-over-year.
Following a very strong first half of the year, we expect demand trends to moderate in the second half as weaker global GDP and the maturing Win 10 commercial refresh drive a lower PC TAM. Again, we also expect to increase our market segment share as we have greater supply for entry PC designs. Additionally, we are forecasting lower modem revenue in the second half.
We expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be up approximately 10% for the full year on strong cloud demand and increased 5G build-outs. After significant cloud expansion in the first half and into Q3, we expect capacity expansion to moderate as CSPs move to a digestion phase. We are also planning for an increasingly competitive environment as we move into the second half. We expect continued global GDP-related impacts to our IOTG and Mobileye businesses in the second half of the year. Overall, our implied first half/second half revenue contribution is an anomalous 53% to 47% as opposed to a more typical year with underserved seasonal volume patterns of 46% and 54%, respectively.
Gross margin is expected to be 58% for the year, down 1 point versus our original expectations for the year and 2 points lower year-over-year. This change is being largely driven by higher costs from higher-than-expected demand for our 10-nanometer products and the pushout of a government grant for our memory business. These effects, coupled with softness in our IoT businesses, more than offset the stronger overall demand, improved mix in DCG and the shift in some spending between OpEx and cost of sales related to the product timing delays Bob discussed earlier.
Spending for the year is expected to be approximately $19.7 billion or 26% of revenue, down 1 point year-on-year. Full year spending is up versus our January expectations on higher R&D expenditures, including the previously discussed shift between OpEx and cost of sales and costs related to COVID, partially offsetting the cost reductions on the modem exit and other portfolio actions as well as ongoing SG&A productivity gains. The resulting operating margin is 32%, down 1 point year-over-year the tax rate is expected to be 14.5%, reflecting the impact of discrete items and the lower FDII benefit.
Full year EPS of $4.85 is $0.15 below our January expectations as increased server and notebook PC demand and slightly higher equity gains are more than offset by COVID-related impacts to IOTG and Mobileye, higher product costs from accelerating 10 nanometer, a higher tax rate and the impacts of improving our liquidity by raising additional debt and temporarily pausing our share buyback. The combination of our liquidity actions and the higher tax rate alone impact full year EPS by more than $0.15. We expect 2020 CapEx of approximately $15 billion and free cash flow of approximately $17.5 billion.
To conclude, I'd like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide. Very much appreciate the hard work of our employees and contractors who delivered excellent results in the face of a very difficult environment.
With that, I'll hand it back to Trey, and we'll get to your questions.

All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wanted to dig into the competitive and the financial implications of the 7-nanometer delays that, Bob, you mentioned. So on the competitive side, by the time you come out with 7, TSMC is planning to be on the 3-nanometer node so will still be a generation ahead. So what's the market share implication of that?
And then related, on the financial side, what's the CapEx and gross margin implications and even pricing implications if you stay on 10-nanometer longer next year? And I guess the bigger question that a lot of investors would have is, at what point Intel should just consider outsourcing a lot more to foundries so that you can keep in line with the state-of-the-art and manufacturing technology?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trey Campbell, Intel Corporation - Head of IR [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I mean, first, our primary focus is on ensuring that we're delivering leadership -- an annual cadence of leadership products each and every year for our customers in a predictable manner. So what we talked about today is a strong lineup for 2020, 2021, 2022 for both client and server. And we feel very good about that lineup. And our expectation on 10-nanometer, much like what we're able to do on 14-nanometer, is to get another node of performance within that -- within 10-nanometer in and of itself. So we feel very good about our product road map through 2022.
That being said, as we think about that next-generation of products in late '22 and '23 and beyond, we need to make sure that we continue to deliver strong performance. And our priorities in the ideal world is leadership products on our process technology, so we capture the economic benefits of IDM. But the focus will be leadership products. So to the extent that we need to view somebody else's process technology, and we call those contingency plans, we will be prepared to do that. And if we do, there's lots of moving parts, but the economic implications in the event that we decide to move to somebody else's foundry, and with our scale, how do you get ASPs in line with our cost, continue to deliver leadership products so we capture attractive ASPs and to reduce the amount of capital that we have to deploy to build a foundry on an older node or on a last gen kind of process node.
So in the aggregate, for the last couple of years, with the real focus on product leadership, we've been engaging with the ecosystem in a much more holistic way. We've been designing our products and advancing our packaging technology so that we have much more flexibility to decide if and when we will use our fabs or somebody else's to deliver that annual cadence of leadership products. We feel very good through '22 time frame, and now we're evaluating the optionality that we have on '23 and beyond.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vivek, let me just comment on your question around what we're going to see -- what we might see next year. Next year is still going to be as it was when we talked about it last in May of '19, still going to be largely a 10-nanometer with some 14-nanometer year. And the dynamics there are as we're coming into it with having moved a little bit further along the yield curve, as we've seen more demand for 10-nanometer products in 2020 than we had expected. So we're not going to update '21 at this time, but I think we're more concerned about what the global economy is doing than where we are on 10-nanometer.

Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess a follow-up question on the 7-nanometer delay. I guess curious how should we think about the implications for CapEx and required capacity adds at 10-nanometer and 14-nanometer. And then just to circle back on the comment around contingency plans after '22, considering your first data center CPU will launch in first half '23, are you suggesting that, that could be found out and not be built internally at Intel?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I think the first part of your question, in the -- with 2022 being, in essence, a full array of 10-nanometer products, the expectation is, all else equal, a little more 10-nanometer spend and less 7-nanometer spend, provided we decide to continue to do all of our production inside. In the event we decide that we're going to leverage third-party foundries more effectively, we would have a little more 10 and a lot less 7. And that's kind of the optionality that we've tried to build in as we evaluate the future of Moore's Law, invest in technology development leadership. In the event we're not there and there's a better alternative, be prepared to take advantage of it.

Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sticking on the same topic of 7-nanometer. Bob, if you could just help me understand, yields are 12-month behind where you would expect them, but the product ramp is only 6. If you could square that circle, that would be helpful. But more importantly, you had multiple sort of pushouts of 10-nanometer. You're identifying this 7-nanometer pushout today. What confidence level do you have that this is sort of a one-and-done issue and it doesn't turn into a repeat of 10 where you kind of had multiple periods of pushouts?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, John. I mean, first, product schedule slippage of roughly 2 quarters, while process we expect now to be roughly 4 quarters. The difference of the gap is driven by a couple of things: one, a buffer in our planning process between process and products to make sure that we don't -- minimal disruption on customers because of process; second, as I've mentioned in the prepared remarks, die disaggregation and advanced packaging gives us the ability for a given SoC to do some stuff inside and some stuff outside and, therefore, further compress the product delivery in light of process slippage. So that's why we've been able to be confident in a 6-month product ship slip, even though process was moving out 12 months.
In terms of -- I think your second question was about we've seen this movie before, maybe. And I think the importance of our many lessons coming out of 10-nanometer, one of them was how do we ensure that we have contingency plans in the event that our advancements in process technology, as it gets increasingly complicated, do not play out the way we'd hope, how do we make sure that we can continue to deliver leadership products for our customers on that annual cadence.
So I'm sure things won't play out exactly the way we want. We think we've dialed in 7. But at the same time, what's different is we're going to be pretty pragmatic about if and when we should be making stuff inside or making outside and making sure that we have optionality to build internally, mix and match inside and outside or go outside in its entirety if we need to. And that's kind of one of our learnings coming out of 10 is, in the event process doesn't move along as we expect, let's make absolutely sure, with advanced contingency planning and real milestones, that we can glitch the best we can to leverage somebody else and not slip product schedules in light of process complexities.

Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Clark Seymore, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm going to stick with the theme and ask about the 7-nanometer as well. I guess, Bob, it's great to hear that you're being -- you're saying you're going to be more pragmatic about internal versus external. But it seems like contingency plan 3 years down the road is how the external option is being treated. I think investors are frustrated with how long the misexecution on the manufacturing has happened. Are there steps where, instead of being a contingency plan, you actually start making the external side the primary source before 2023, obviously, on the design side more than the revenue side? And maybe a follow-up. If 3 to 5 years down the road, the 20/80, 20 external, 80 internal mix, do you think that changes?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me -- maybe I'll flip those around. Over the last couple of years, we've been talking about, as we expand our capacity, evaluating more holistically when do we use third-party foundries rather than do everything ourselves. And we call that engaging in the ecosystem in much more holistic ways for a variety of different reasons, so we don't have to build everything ourselves as the capital associated with each node becomes a bit higher. So in general, I would say, for planning purposes, we've been engaging with the ecosystem much more. And all else equal, I would expect that roughly 20% to be a little bit higher as we focus on growing the business.
Your first question in terms of planning then, we have -- we feel like we have a real solid product road map, again, for the second half of this year, for '21 and for '22, and that we'll do it on our existing 10-nanometer that's ramping faster than we expected. It yields in line with what we expected. So for the near term, we think we got a great lineup of products, and we expect to fight and protect our share while expanding the role we play in a variety of different places in the industry.
But now is when we're planning for '22, '23. And we are evaluating now -- in light of where we are, where we think the industry, the competition of third parties are, evaluating now what's the best option for us to make sure that we can deliver an annual cadence of product leadership for our customers. And those decisions are not decisions that we'll make in 2023. Those decisions based on the information that we have along the way will be made long before then, whether it's decisions about how much capacity we need to put in place or decisions about how do we leverage more effectively somebody else's process capabilities and factories so that we can get real good incremental returns on capital deployed.

Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to ask about the acceleration in 10-nanometer. Is this really because yields are getting better and there's higher demand or because you're trying to offset the 7-nanometer delay? Because it's hitting the margins big time, which doesn't really tie in my head to, like, yields getting hugely better versus where you thought they were going to be in January. So how do I think about the drivers of that 7-nanometer acceleration in light of the 7 -- or 10-nanometer acceleration in light of the 7-nanometer delay given what it's doing to the margins?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Stacy, this is George. Maybe I'll just cover it in general on the margin picture for the year because it's clearly -- it's having an impact there. The acceleration is really definitionally tied to the fact that we're growing faster than we expected in 2020. And we're -- part of that growth is a higher mix on the PC side and, I would say, on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand for products that are on 10-nanometer than we had forecasted for the year. So it's why you're seeing a little less flow-through on revenue than we would have expected for the year. It's a positive growth story in that, again, we're seeing customers attracted to the 10-nanometer products.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But wait a minute, if I look at your annual guidance now versus where it was in the beginning of the year, it's higher, but it's actually lower in the second half versus what you had implied in -- when you first gave the annual guidance 6 months ago. How does that imply that demand is higher versus where you were now given you've actually lowered the second half?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's the demand for 10-nanometer products within the mix of our overall revenue, Stacy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I think I'd start with our full year demand relative to where we were at the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue. So that's...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, but you're just making it sound like where you can typically get to, is there...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me just finish, Stacy. I think it's a good question, but maybe if you could give me a chance to answer it. So full year demand for the company is higher. Secondly, the yields for 10-nanometer we've kind of set are in line with what we expected coming into the year through the first 6 months, and we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, that the overall demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector is higher than we expected. That is part of the contribution to the $1.5 billion of higher revenue for the year. And as we accelerate 10 faster, because customers are banding it more, the implications are that our margins, all else equal, will be lower. George kind of highlighted those were the primary drivers of the 1 point decline. 10-nanometer products are ramping faster, and our 5G comms business and the Data Center Group is growing much quicker than we had anticipated.
I put that -- I put ramping of 10-nanometer faster in the good category. We feel -- we know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an old node. 10-nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the game. Ramping 10, we think, is a good thing for customers. We do take a dip in yield. If it's more of our growth than we had anticipated, all else equal, margins will be a little bit lower. And that's kind of the updated guidance for the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 10-nanometer products that we're ramping as we -- ramping yields as we expected with more volume, all else equal, will have a modest impact on our gross margin for the full year. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wanted to ask also on the same manufacturing topic. So I think, Bob, when you were talking about Ponte Vecchio, I think you said that you're going to package it internally, but it seemed like you were implying an external foundry contingency even for this first GPU product. I guess my question is, did I read that right? And also, I wanted to ask, George, what the long-term implications are if you move to somebody else's fab? What does this do to your 57% to 63% long-term gross margin? And how does it impact free cash flow? I mean, obviously, it saves you on CapEx, but can it be accretive to free cash flow?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. On the -- on Ponte Vecchio, originally, the architecture of Ponte Vecchio includes an I/O-based die connectivity, a GPU and some memory tiles, all kind of packaged together. That's kind of the design of Ponte Vecchio. From the beginning, we would do some of those tiles inside and some of those tiles outside and again leverage the packaging technology as a proof point of how do we mix and match different designs into one package. So that was the design from the beginning. And again, when we talk about disaggregation, more flexibility, optionality in our designs, use some stuff inside, some stuff outside, Ponte Vecchio was really -- Ponte Vecchio on the data center side and Lakefield on the client side were kind of our test products, both the -- one of which we've launched; the other one, which is in development. So that design disaggregation gives us lots of flexibility.
As we go forward now, we can think about whether we introduce Ponte Vecchio with -- I think I said some of those tiles are inside and outside from the beginning. Now as we go forward, we can assess whether we swap out one of our tiles for a third-party foundry or not. Again, that's the beauty and the value of this change in design methodology that gives us much more optionality and flexibility. So in the event there's a process slip, we can buy something rather than make it all ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And with respect to the long-term outlook, first off, our long-term margin outlook is not 57%. We've talked about it being well above that over time. But in terms of -- as we dynamically move -- potentially move product depending on where it is best provided, I think that certainly gives us more flexibility to optimize our capital spend, get a higher return on that capital spend. And it should be accretive to free cash flow. So we talked a little bit about that actually back in May of '19 that embracing the ecosystem and balancing some of our activity externally is going to be important as we look to improving returns over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weston David Twigg, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I just wanted to ask about the data-centric revenue heading into Q3. The mid-single-digit decline year-over-year implies a pretty big decline from Q2. You helped a little bit on the call, but I'm wondering if you could help us better understand the reason for that big quarterly drop. And kind of as an aside, you also mentioned increased competition in DCG in the second half, and I'm just wondering what exactly you're referring to on that side.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. As you look at the data-centric revenue, we'll see a number of factors at play. Obviously, year-over-year, you're going to see the impact of the falloff in IoT and in Mobileye. But what we're seeing in the data-centric -- or the DCG side is we think we peaked on cloud in the second quarter, and it was an all-time record, so not a bad peak. We've probably peaked back in Q4 of '19 on enterprise and government. And while it was reasonably strong in Q1, it's -- you can see it coming down over the next few quarters. It may have -- it often has a little bit of a bounce in Q4, we'll have to see. And our comms provider, I would say, we expect Q2 to have been a peak there, and that'll start rolling off from there. So everything on the DCG side has got a step-down from a very strong Q2 and probably continues down on cloud and comms as our current outlook. Does that help?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weston David Twigg, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay. Yes. That's helpful. And then the comment on increased competition in DCG in second half.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. We expected, based on the competition's product road map, that we would see increasing competition in the second half of this year. We also thought -- we've been a little bit pleasantly surprised in the strength of our -- the demand for our products in the first half of the year, and it's continuing into the second half. So we don't think the impact will be quite as large competitively in the second half as we had thought. And as I said on PC, we think we're going to actually gain share.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would just say it's -- we had -- when we guided back in January, in the context of our guidance, we made that statement. So George is just reiterating that, that we see a more competitive world, and we'll be prepared to deal with it. And we've factored that into our outlook for the second half of the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trey Campbell, Intel Corporation - Head of IR [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator, I think we have time for one more question, and then we'll turn the call back over to Bob to wrap things up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And our final question comes from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri, SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

George, I have a question about your guidance for the full year. I think it implies DCG declining again in Q4, pretty much in double-digit sequentially. So just trying to understand, I mean, is it primarily because of digestion that you talked about? And also if you can talk about to what extent you have visibility into Q4. Are you just taking a conservative stance because you just simply don't have visibility into Q4?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis, Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think as I said on the last question that we have a reasonable view that spending is going to be coming down in the cloud and in enterprise and even comms off of very high levels, and we expect that to continue into Q4. And so again, I think when we look at the full year, stronger than expected. Overall, this is -- this would be -- in many ways, we're delighted to be as close to our forecast as we were given all of the things going on in the world. But again, we've seen very strong demand peaking for cloud in the third quarter -- excuse me, the second quarter; peaking for comms in the second quarter. And it's just going to be a period of a little bit of digestion as one would expect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan, Intel Corporation - CEO & Director [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Let me just kind of close out and end where we began. First, over the last couple of years, as you know, we've expanded our TAM in the quest to play a much larger role in our customers' success by investing in key leading technologies like 5G, AI and intelligence at the edge. And we feel pretty good about the investments that we've been making. And last year, we wrapped up our best year in the company's history, entering 2020. Obviously, this year has been an incredibly challenging year on multiple fronts. But at the same time, we expect '20 to be the best year in our company's history, our fifth record year in a row, delivering better results than we expected in January at a time when the market is worse than we expected. So competitively, we feel stronger as we exit 2020.
Third point I'd make is our execution has improved. Capacity and supply is in place. We're ramping a slew of 10-nanometer products across our portfolio. We are ramping 10 faster than we had planned and we have a strong leadership -- a strong pipeline over the next several years. And we believe we can deliver another notable performance on 10-nanometer itself.
Fourth point, at the same time, our 7-nanometer products will be delayed. We've pushed out the timing of the 7-nanometer node. But along the way, we have taken steps on die disaggregation, advanced packaging, deeper engagement with the ecosystem and contingency planning as a sign of strength, not as a sign of weakness, that gives us much more flexibility to make the decisions on where is the most effective way to build our products to deliver that annual cadence of leadership for our customers. And we feel pretty good about where we are, though we're not happy. I'm not pleased with our 7-nanometer process performance.
But as we sit here today, 6 months through the year, our people are safe. We're delivering for our customers. The communities we operate in are better as a result of our presence and the passion of our employees for making a difference. And next 90 days from now, we'll talk more about our efforts to create world-changing technologies that continue to enrich the lives of every person on earth. So thanks for joining us, and we'll talk to you soon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress, NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Simona. Q2 revenue was $2.58 billion, in line with our outlook, down 17% year-on-year and up 16% sequentially.
Starting with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.31 billion was down 27% year-on-year and up 24% sequentially. We are pleased with the strong sequential growth in the quarter when we launched our RTX SUPER lineup for desktop gamers, wrapped up our greatest ever number of gaming laptops and launched our new RTX studio laptops for creators. In July, we unveiled 3 GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs, delivering the best-in-class gaming performance and power efficiency and real-time ray tracing for both current and next-generation games. These GPUs delivered a performance boost of up to 24% from our initial Turing GPUs launched a year earlier. The SUPER lineup strengthens our leadership in the high end of the market, and the response has been great. We look forward to delighting gamers with the best performance in ray tracing as we get into the back to school and holiday shopping seasons.
Ray tracing is taking the gaming industry by storm and have quickly come to define the modern era of computer graphics. A growing number of blockbuster AAA titles have announced support for NVIDIA RTX ray tracing, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Super Punk 2077 (sic) [Cyberpunk 2077], Watch Dogs: Legion and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. Excitement around these titles is tremendous. GameSpot called Cyberpunk one of the most anticipated games of the decade. NVIDIA GeForce RTX are the only graphic cards in the market with hardware support for ray tracing. They deliver a 2 to 3x performance speed up over GPUs without a dedicated ray tracing core.
The laptop business continues to be a standout growth driver as OEMs are ramping a record 100-plus gaming laptop models ahead of the back to school and holiday season. The combination of our energy-efficient Turing architecture and Max-Q technology enables beautifully crafted thin and light form factors that can deliver the performance of high-end gaming desktop or our next-generation console.
At Computex in May, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX Studio laptops, a new design artist platform that extends our reach to the large, underserved market of creators. In the age of YouTube, creators and freelancers are rapidly growing population, but they have traditionally not had access to professional-grade workstations through online and retail channels. RTX Studio laptops are designed to meet their increasing complex workflows such as photorealistic ray tracing, AI image enhancement and ultra high-resolution video. Powered by our RTX GPUs and optimized software, RTX Studio laptops deliver performance that's up to 7x faster than that of the MacBook Pro. A total of 27 RTX Studio models have been announced by major OEMs.
Sequential growth also benefited from the production ramp of the 2 new models of Nintendo Switch gaming console. We are expecting our console business to remain strong in Q3 before the seasonal production slowdown in Q4 when console-related revenue is expected to be fairly minimal, similar to last year.
Moving to data center. Revenue was $655 million, down 14% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially. In the vertical industries portion of the business, expanding AI workload drove sequential and year-over-year growth. In hyperscale portion, we continue to be impacted by relatively weak overall spending at a handful of CPU -- CSPs. Sales of NVIDIA GPUs for use in the cloud were solid. While sales of internal hyperscale use were muted, the engineering focus on AI is growing.
Let me give some color on each of these areas. We are building a broad base of customers across multiple industries as they adopt NVIDIA's platforms to harness the power of AI. Public sectors, higher education and financial services were among the key verticals driving growth this quarter. In addition, we won Lighthouse account deals in important industries that are on the cusp of being transformed by AI. For example, in retail, Walmart is using NVIDIA GPUs to run some of its product demand forecasting models, slashing the time to do so in just 4 hours from several weeks on CPUs. By accelerating its data science workflow, Walmart can improve its algorithms, reduce development cycles and test new features.
Earlier this week, we announced breakthroughs for the fastest training and inference of the state-of-the-art model for natural language process understanding called BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations of -- from Transformers, a breakthrough AI language model that achieves a deeper sense of language, context and meaning. This can enable mere human comprehension in real-time by chat box, intelligent personal assistants and search engines. We are working with Microsoft as an early adopter of these advances.
AI computing leadership is a high priority for NVIDIA. Last month, we set records for training deep learning neural network models on the latest MLPerf benchmarks, particularly in the most demanding areas. In just 7 months, we have achieved up to 80% speed-ups enabled by new algorithms and software optimizations across the full stack while using the same hardware. This is a direct result of the productive programming environment and flexibility of CUDA.
Delivering AI at scale isn't just about silicon. It's about optimizing across the entire high-performance computing system. In fact, the NVIDIA AI platform is getting progressively faster. Every month, we publish new optimization and performance improvements to CUDA-X AI libraries, supporting every AI framework and development environment. All in, our ecosystem of developers is now 1.4 million strong.
In setting these MLPerf records, we leveraged our new DGX SuperPOD AI supercomputer, demonstrating that leadership in AI research demands leadership in computing infrastructure. This system debuted in June at #22 on the TOP500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers at the annual International Supercomputing Conference. Used to meet the massive demand for autonomous vehicle development program, it is powered by more than 1,500 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs linked with Mellanox interconnects. We've made DGX SuperPOD available commercially to customers, essentially providing them with the turnkey supercomputer that they can assemble in weeks rather than months. It is roughly 400x smaller in size than other similarly performing TOP500 systems, which are built from thousands of servers.
Also at the conference, we announced that by next year's end, we will make available to the ARM ecosystem NVIDIA's full stack of AI and HPC software, which accelerates more than 600 HPC applications and all AI frameworks. With this announcement, NVIDIA will accelerate all major CPU architectures, including x86, POWER and ARM.
Lastly, regarding our pending acquisition of Mellanox, we have received regulatory approval in the U.S. and are engaged with regulators in Europe and China. The approval process is progressing as expected, and we continue to work toward closing the deal by the end of this calendar year.
Moving to pro visualization. Revenue reached $291 million, up 4% from our prior year and up 9% sequentially. Year-on-year and sequential growth was led by record revenue for mobile workstations with strong demand for new thin and light form factors. We had a great showing at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics industry's biggest annual conference held in Los Angeles. Our researchers won several Best in Show awards. In just a year since the launch of RTX ray tracing, over 40 design and creative applications with RTX technology had been announced by leading software vendors, including Adobe, Autodesk and Dassault systems and many others. NVIDIA RTX technology has reinvigorated the computer graphics industry by enabling researchers and developers to take a leap in photorealistic rendering, augmented reality and virtual reality.
Finally, turning to automotive. Q2 revenue was $209 million, up 30% from a year ago and up 26% sequentially. This reflects growing adoption of next-generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development projects, including 1 particularly sizable development services transaction that was recognized in the quarter. In addition, in June, we announced a new partnership with the Volvo Group to develop AI and autonomous trucks utilizing NVIDIA's end-to-end AI platform for training, simulation and in-vehicle computing. The strategic partnership will enable Volvo Group to develop a wide range of autonomous driving solutions for freight transport, recycling collection, public transport, construction, mining, forestry and more. This collaboration is a great validation of our long-held position that every vehicle, not just cars but also trucks, shuttles, business, taxis and many others, will have autonomous capability 1 day.
Autonomous features can bring enormous value to the trucking industry, in particular as the demand of online shopping put ever greater stress on the world's transport systems. Expectations for overnight or same-day deliveries create challenges that can only be met by autonomous trucks, which can operate 24 hours a day. To help address these needs, NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to large-scale simulation to in-car computing. Multiple customers from OEMs like Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and Volvo to Tier 1s like Bosch, Continental and ZF are already onboard. We see this as a $30 billion addressable market by 2025.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q2 GAAP gross margins was 59.8% and non-GAAP was 60.1%, up sequentially, reflecting higher automotive development services, a favorable mix in gaming and lower component cost. GAAP operating expenses were $970 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $749 million, up 19% and 8% year-on-year, respectively. We remain on track for high single-digit OpEx growth in fiscal 2020 while continuing to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, namely graphics, AI and self-driving cars. GAAP EPS was $0.90, down 49% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.24, down 36% from a year ago.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect revenue to be $2.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62% and 62.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $980 million and $765 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $100 million to $120 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the Jefferies conference, hardware and communications infrastructure summit, on August 27 and at the Citi Global Technology Conference on September 25.
With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for the questions?

================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess first question on gaming, how should we think about your outlook into the October quarter vis-à-vis kind of normal seasonality? How are you thinking about Switch within that? And considering now that you have full Turing lineup as well as content truly coming to the forefront here, how do you think about trends beyond the October quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Colette, why don't you take the Switch question? And then I'll take the rest of the RTX questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress, NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. From a gaming perspective, the overall Switch or the overall console business definitely is a seasonal business. We usually expect to see production ramping in Q2 and in Q3, with it coming down likely in Q4. So you should see Switch to be a portion definitely of our gaming business in Q3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. C.J., thanks for the question. RTX, as you know, is -- first of all, RTX is doing great. I think we've put all the pieces in place to bring ray tracing into the future of games. The number of games, the blockbuster games that adopted RTX is really snowballing. We announced several -- 6 games in the last couple of months. There's going to be some exciting announcements next week at gamescom. It's pretty clear now the future of gaming will include ray tracing. The number of software developers that create -- with creative tools that adopted RTX is really quite spectacular. We now have 40 -- over 40 ISV tools that was announced at SIGGRAPH that have accelerated ray tracing and video editing. And some of the applications' amazing AI capabilities for image optimization enhancement support RTX. And so looking forward, this is what I expect. I expect that ray tracing is going to drive a reinvigoration of gaming graphics. I expect that the over 100 laptops that we have RTX designed -- RTX GPUs designed into is going to contribute our growth. Notebook gaming is one of the fastest-growing segments of the gaming platform world. The number of notebooks that are able to game is only a few percent, so it's extremely underexposed. And yet, we know that gamers are -- like the rest of us, they like thin and light notebooks, but they like it to be able to run powerful games. And so this is an area that has grown significantly for us year-over-year, and we're expecting it to grow through the end of the -- through the second half and through next year.
And one of the things that's really exciting is our RTX Studio line that we introduced recently. We observed, and through our discussions with the PC industry, that the creatives are really underexposed and underserved by the latest technologies. And they want notebooks and they want PCs that have powerful graphics. They use it for 3D content creation and high definition video editing and image optimization and things like that. And we introduced a brand-new line of computers that we call RTX Studio. Now the OEMs were so excited about it. And at SIGGRAPH, we now have 27 different laptops shipping and more coming. And so I think RTX is really geared for growth. We have great games coming. We got the SUPER line of GPUs. We have all of our notebooks that were designed into that we're ramping and, of course, the new RTX Studio line. And so I expect this to be a growth market for us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very helpful. If I could follow up on the data center side, perhaps you can speak directly just to the hyperscale side, both internal and cloud, and whether you're seeing any green shoots, any signs of life there and how you're thinking about what that rate of recovery could look like over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the exception of a couple of hyperscalers, C.J., I would -- we're seeing broad-based growth in data centers. In the area of training, the thing that's really exciting everybody, and everybody is racing towards, is training these large gigantic natural language understanding models, language models. The transformer model that was introduced by Google, called BERT, has since been enhanced into XLned and RoBERTa and, gosh, so many different, GP2, and Microsoft's MASS. And there's so many different versions of these language models. And in the AI, NLU, natural language understanding, is one of the most important areas that everybody's racing to go to. And so these models are really, really large. It's over 1,000x larger than image models that we're training just a few years ago, and they're just gigantic models. It's one of the reasons why we built the DGX SuperPOD so that we could train these gigantic models in a reasonable amount of time. The second area -- so that's training in the hyperscalers.
The second area where we're seeing enormous amounts of activity has to do with trying to put these conversational AI models into services so that they could be interactive and in real time. Whereas photo tagging and photo enhancement is something that you could put off-line and you could do that while you have excess capacity when it's off of the most busy time of the day. You can't do that with language and conversational AI. You better to respond to the person in real time. And so the performance that's required is significant. But more importantly, the number of models necessary for conversational AI from speech recognition to language understanding to recommendation systems to text-to-speech to wave synthesis, these 5, 6, 7 models have to be processed in real time -- in series and in real time so that you can have a reasonable conversation with the AI agent.
And so these type of activities is really driving interest and activity at all of the hyperscalers. My expectation is that this is going to continue to be a big growth opportunity for us. But more importantly, in addition to that, we're seeing that AI is -- the wave of AI is going from the cloud to the enterprise to the edge and all the way out to the autonomous systems. The place where we're seeing a lot of excitement, and we talked about that in the past and we're seeing growth there, has to do with the vertical industry enterprises that are starting to adopt AI to create new products, whether it's a delivery robot or some kind of a chat bot or the ability to detect fraud in financial services, these applications in vertical industries are really spreading all over the place. There's some over 4,000 AI start-ups around the world. And the way that we engage them is they use our platform to start developing AI in the cloud. And as you know, we're the only AI platform that's available on-prem and in every single cloud. And so they can use our AI platforms for -- in all the clouds, which is driving our cloud computing, external cloud computing growth. And then they can also use it on-prem if their usage really grows significantly. And that's one of the reasons why our Tesla for OEMs and DGX is growing. And so we're seeing broad-based excitement around AI as they use it for their products and new services. And these 4,000, 4,500 start-ups around the world is really driving consumption of that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I actually had 2 as well, one quick one for Colette and one for Jensen. Colette, good to see the gross margin recovery getting into October. Is this 62% to 63% range a more sustainable level and perhaps a level you could grow off of as sales get more normalized levels? And then a bigger question is for Jensen. Again, on the data center side, Jensen, when I look back between -- 2015 to 2018, your data center business essentially grew 10x. And then the last year has been a tough one with the slowdown in cloud CapEx and so forth. When do you think your data center starts to grow back on a year-to-year -- on a year-on-year basis? Can that happen sometime -- later this year? And then just longer term, what is the right way to think about this business? Does it go back to prior levels? Does it go at a different phase? This is the one part of the business that I think is toughest for us to model, so any color would be very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress, NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. So let me start first with your question, Vivek, regarding gross margins. Yes, thanks for recognizing that we are moving towards our expectations that, over time, we'll continue to see our overall volumes improve. Essentially, our business is normalized. We've reached normalized levels through the last couple of quarters. And this quarter, just very similar to what we will see going forward, is mix is the largest driver, what drives our overall gross margins and our gross margin improvements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Vivek, if you look at the last several years, there's no question our data center business has grown a lot. And my expectation is that it's going to grow a lot more, and let me explain to you why. Aside from a couple -- a few of uncontrollable circumstances and the exception of a couple of large customers, the overall trend, the broad-based trend, of our data center business is upward, to the right. And it is growing very nicely. There's a couple of different dynamics that's causing that on first principles to grow. And of course, one of them is as AI is well known now to require accelerated computing, our computing architecture is really ideal for it. AI is not just one network. It's thousands of different types of networks, and these networks are getting more and more complex over time, the amount of data you have to process is enormous. And so like all software programs, you can't predict exactly how the software is going to get programmed. And having a programmable architecture like CUDA and yet optimized for AI like Tensor Cores that we've created is really the ideal architecture.
We know also that AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. The ability for machines to learn and write software by itself and write software that no humans can write is pretty extraordinary. And the applications of AI, as you guys are watching yourself, are just spreading in every single industry. And so the way we think about AI is in waves, if you will. The first wave of AI is developing the computer architecture, and that was the first part where -- that's when a lot of people discovered who we are, and we emerged into the world of high-performance computing in AI. The second wave is applying the AI for cloud service providers or hyperscalers. They have a large amount of data. They have a lot of consumer applications. Many of them are not life-critical and so, therefore, the application of an early technology -- early-adoption technology was really viable. And so you saw hyperscalers adopt AI. And the thing that's really exciting for us is beyond recommendations, beyond image enhancement, the area where we believe the most important application for AI is likely conversational AI. Most people talking and asking questions and talking to their mobile devices and looking for something or asking for directions. Instead of having a page of -- a list of options, it responds with an answer that is very likely a good one.
The next phase of AI is what we call vertical industry enterprise AI. And this is where companies are using it not just to accelerate the business process internally, but they're using AI to create new products and services. They could be new medical instruments to IoT-based medical instruments to monitor your health. It could be something related to an application that -- used for financial services for forecasting or for fraud detection. It could be some kind of device that delivers pizza to you, delivery bots. And the combination of IoT and artificial intelligence, for the very first time, you actually have the software capabilities to make use of all of these sensors that you're putting all over the world. And that's the next phase of growth. And it affects companies from large industrials, transportation companies, retailers, you name it. Health care companies, you name it. And so that phase of growth of AI is the phase that we're about to enter into.
And then the longer term is an industry that we all know to be extremely large, but it takes time because it's life-critical, and it has to do with transportation. It's a $100 trillion industry. We know it's going to be automated. We know that everything that moves in the future will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities. And that's just a matter of time before we realize its full potential.
And so the net of it all is that I believe that AI is the single most powerful technology force of our time, and that's why we're all in on it. And we know that acceleration and accelerated computing is the perfect model for that. And it started in the cloud, but it's going to keep moving out into the edge and through data centers and enterprises and hopefully -- well, eventually, all the way out into autonomous devices and machines in the real world. And so this is a big market, and I'm super enthusiastic about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toshiya Hari, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had 2 as well, one for Jensen and the other for Colette. Jensen, you guys called out inference as a significant contributor to growth in data center last quarter. I think you guys talked about it being a double-digit percentage contributor, curious what you saw from inference in the quarter. And more importantly, if you can talk about the outlook, both near term and long term, as it relates to inference, that'll be helpful. And then secondly, for Colette, just want to double click on the gross margin question. The sequential improvement that you're guiding to is a pretty significant number. So I was just hoping if you can kind of break it down for us in terms of overall volume growth mix dynamics, both between segments and within segments and also to the extent DRAM pricing is impacting that, any color on that will be helpful as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Toshiya, I got to tell you, I'm less good at normal pre -- near-term productions than I am good at thinking about long-term dynamics. But let me talk to you about inference. Our inference business is -- remains robust. It's double digits. It's a large part of our business. And -- but more importantly, the 2 dynamics that I think are near term and that's going to drive growth, number one is interactive conversational AI, interactive conversational AI inference.
If you simply ask a chat bot a simple question, where is the closest pizza and you would -- pizza shop, and you would like to have a conversation with this bot, it would have to do speech recognition, it has to understand what it is that you asked about, it has to look it up in a recommender based on the locations you're at, maybe your preferences of styles of pizza and the price ranges that you're interested and how far you're willing to go, to go get it. It has to recommend a pizza shop for you to go to. It has to then translate that from text-to-speech and then into human -- a human understand a voice.
And those models have to happen in just a few -- ideally, a few hundred milliseconds. Currently, it's not that. And it makes it really hard for these services to be deployed quite broadly and used for all kinds of different applications. And so that's the near-term opportunity, it's interactive conversational AI inference. And you could just imagine every single hyperscaler racing to go make this possible because recently, we had some important breakthroughs in machine learning language models. The BERT model that I mentioned earlier is really, really an important development, and it's caused a large number of derivatives that has improved upon it. And so near-term conversational AI inference.
We're also seeing near term the inference at the edge. There are many types of applications where because of the laws of physics reasons, the speed of light reasons or the economics reasons or data sovereignty reasons, it's not possible to stream the data to the cloud and have the inference done at the cloud. You have to do that at the edge. You need the latency to be low, the amount of data that you're streaming is continuous. And so you don't want to be paying for that line rate the whole time, and maybe the data is of great confidentiality or privacy. And so we're seeing a lot of excitement and a lot of development for edge AI. Smart retail, smart warehouses, smart factories, smart cities, smart airports, you just make a list of those kind of things, basically locations where there is a lot of activity, where safety or cost or large amount of materials is passing through, you could just imagine the applications. All of those really want to be edge computing systems and edge inference systems. And so those are near term -- 2 near-term drivers, and I think it's fair to say that both of them are quite large opportunities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress, NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So to answer your question regarding gross margin in a little bit more detail, probably our largest area that we expect improvement in terms of our mix is our mix return regarding our overall gaming business. We expect to have a full quarter of our SUPER lineup within the next quarter, including our RTX as well as our notebook becoming a bigger mix as well as it grows. These drivers are one of the largest reasons why we see that growth in our gross margin. We always think about our component cost, our overall cost of manufacturing, so this is always baked in over time, but we'll continue to see improvements on that as well.

And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harlan Sur, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Again, your data center business, many of your peers on the compute and storage side are seeing spending recovery by cloud and hyperscalers in the second half of this year after a similar weak first half of the year. You guys saw some growth in Q2 driven primarily by enterprise. It seems like you had some broadening out of the customer spending this quarter. Inferencing continues to see strong momentum. Would you guys expect that this translates into a double-digit percentage sequential growth in data center in Q3 off of the low base in Q2?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our hyperscale data center with a few customers don't give us very much -- we don't get very much visibility from a handful of customers in hyperscale. However, we're seeing broad-based growth and excitement in data centers. And the way to think about data center, our data center business consists of hyperscale training, internal training, hyperscale inference, cloud computing -- and that's hyperscale, and that cloud is a public cloud. And then we have vertical industry enterprise, what sometimes we call enterprise, vertical industry enterprise, it could be transportation companies, retailers, telcos, vertical industry adoption of AI either to accelerate their business or to develop new products and services.
And then the -- so when you look at our data center from that perspective and these pieces, although we don't see as much -- we don't get as much visibility as we like in a couple of the large customers, the rest of the hyperscalers, we're seeing broad-based growth. And so we're experiencing the enthusiasm and the energy that maybe the others are. And so we'll keep reporting -- updating you guys as we go. We'll see how it goes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had 2. I guess first for Jensen, Volta's been around now for about 2 years. Do you see signs of demand maybe building up ahead of the new set of nanometer products, whenever that comes out? I guess I'm just wondering whether there's some element of this is more around product cadence that gets resolved as you do roll out the product. That's the first question.
And then I guess, the second question, Colette, is of the $300 million growth into October, it sounds like Switch is pretty flat, but I'm wondering if you can give us maybe some qualitative sense of where the growth is coming from, is it maybe like 2/3 gaming and 1/3 data centers, something like that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, Volta -- data center products can churn that fast. We -- gamers could churn products quickly because they're bought and sold one at a time. But data centers -- data center infrastructure really has to be planned properly, and the build-out takes time. And we expect Volta to be successful all the way through next year. And software still continues to be improved on it. We're still improving systems on it. And in fact, just 1 year -- in just 1 year, we improved our AI performance on Volta by almost 2x, 80%. And so you could just imagine the amount of software that's built on top of Volta and all the Tensor Cores and all the GPUs connected with NVLink and the large number of nodes that are connected to build supercomputers.
The software of building these systems, large-scale systems, is really, really hard. And that's one of the reasons why you hear people talk about chips, but they never show up because building the software is just an enormous undertaking. The number of software engineers we have in the company is in the thousands, and we have the benefit of having built on top of this architecture for over 1.5 decades. And so when we're able to deploy into data centers as quickly as we do, I think we kind of lose sight of how hard it is to do that in the first place. The last time a new processor entered into a data center was an x86 Xeon, and you just don't bring processors in the data centers that frequently or that easily. And so I think the way to think about Volta is that it's surely in its prime, and it's going to keep -- continue to do well all the way through next year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress, NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In regard to our guidance on revenue, and we do guide in terms of the total. You have seen, in this last quarter, we executed a sequential increase really focusing on moving to a normalization of our gaming business. And we're now approaching the second half of the year getting ready for the back to school and the holidays. So you should expect also our gaming business to continue to grow to reach that full normalization by the end of Q3. We do expect the rest of our platforms to likely also grow. We have a couple different models on how that will come out. But yes, we do expect our data center business to grow, and then we'll see on the rest of our businesses as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew D. Ramsay, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A couple of questions. I guess the first one is, Jensen, if you have any, I guess, high-level qualitative commentary on how the new SUPER upgrades of your Turing platform have been received in the market and how you might think about them progressing through the year. And then, I guess, the second question is a bigger one. Intel's talked quite openly about One API. The software stack at Xilinx is progressing with Versal ACAP. I mean you guys get a lot of credit for the decade of work that you've done on CUDA. But I wonder if you might comment on if you've seen any movement in the competitive landscape on the software side for the data center space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUPER is off to a great start. Goodness, SUPER is off to a super start. And if you look at -- if you do channel checks all over, even though we've got a lot of products in the channel and we -- last quarter was a transitional quarter for us actually. And we didn't -- we shipped SUPER later in the quarter. But because the entire ecosystem and all of our execution engines are so primed, we were able to ship a fair number through the channel. And so -- and yet, if you do spot checks all around the world, they're sold out almost everywhere. And the pricing in the spot market is drifting higher than MSRP. That just tells you something about demand. And so that's really exciting. SUPER is off to a super start for -- and at this point, it's a foregone conclusion that we're going to buy a new graphics card, and it's going to the last 2, 3, 4 years to not have ray tracing is just crazy. Ray tracing content just keeps coming out. And between the performance of SUPER and the fact that it has ray tracing hardware, it's going to be super well positioned for -- throughout all of next year.
Your question about APIs and software programmability. APIs is just one of the issues. The large issue about processors is how do you program it. The reason why x86s and CPUs are so popular is because they solve the great challenge of software developers: how to program a computer. And how to program a computer and how to compile for that computer is a paramount concern to computer science, and it's an area of tremendous research. Going from single CPU to multi-core CPUs was a great challenge. Going from multi-core CPUs to multi-node multi-core CPUs is an enormous challenge. And yet, when we created CUDA in our GPUs, we went from 1 CPU core or one processor core to a few to now, in the case of large-scale systems, millions of processor cores. And how do you program such a computer across multi-GPU, multi-node? It's a concept that's not easy to grasp. And so I don't really know how one programming approach or a simple API is going to make 7 different type of weird things work together. And I can't make it fit in my head. But programming isn't as simple as a PowerPoint slide, I guess. And I think it's just -- time will tell whether one programming approach could fit 7 different types of processors when no time in history has it ever happened.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wonder if you could talk about the strength in the automotive business. Looks like the services piece of that is getting to be bigger. What's the outlook for that part of the business? And can you give us a sense of the mix between services and components at this point?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Thanks, Joe. Our approach to autonomous vehicles comes in basically 2 parts. The first part is a full stack, which is building the architected processor, the system, the system software and all of the driving applications on top, including the deep neural nets. The second part of it, we call that a full stack self-driving car computer. The second part of DRIVE includes an end-to-end AV development system. For those who would like to use our processors, use our system software but create their own applications, we created a system that allows -- basically shares with them our computing infrastructure that we built for ourselves that allows them to do end-to-end development from deep learning development to the application of AV to simulating that application to doing regression testing of that application before they deploy it into a car. And the 2 systems that we use there is called DGX for training and Constellation for simulation and what is called Replay.
And then the third part of our business model is development agreements, otherwise known as NRE. These 3 elements, full stack computer, end-to-end development flow and NRE project development -- product development consists of the overall DRIVE business. And so although the cars will take several years to go into production, we're seeing a lot of interest in working with us to develop self-driving cars using our development systems and entering into development projects. And so we're -- the number of autonomous vehicle projects is quite large around the world as you can imagine. And so my sense is that we're going to continue to do well here. The additional part of autonomous vehicles and where the capability has been derived and is going to seal up more near-term opportunities has to do with things like delivery shuttles, self-driving shuttles and maybe cargo movers inside walled warehouses. Those kind of autonomous machines require basically the same technology, but it's sooner and easier to deploy. And so we are seeing a lot of excitement around that area.

Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Christopher Rakers, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations on the improved performance. At your Analyst Day back a couple of months ago, you had highlighted the installed base opportunity for RTX. And I think at that point in time, you talked about 50% being Pascal base, 48% being pre-Pascal. You also alluded to the fact that you were seeing a positive mix shift higher in terms of the price points of this RTX cycle. So I'm curious, where do we stand on the current product cycle? And what are you seeing currently as we go through this product cycle on the Turing platforms?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We launched -- well, first of all, the answer is that RTX adoption is faster than Pascal's adoption if you normalize to time 0 of launch. The reason for that is Pascal launched top to bottom on the same day. And as you guys know, we weren't able to do that for Turing. But if we did that for Turing, the adoption rate is actually faster. And to me, it's a rather sensible. And the reason for that is because Pascal was basically DX12. And Maxwell was DX12. And Turing is the world's first DXR, the first ray tracing GPU, brand-new functionality, brand-new API and a lot more performance. And so I think it's sensible that Turing's adoption is going to be rapid.
The second element of Turing is something that we've never talked about before. We're mentioning it more and more because it's such an exciting book market for us is notebooks. The install base of Pascal has a very, very little notebook in it. And the reason for that is because, in the past, we were never able to put a high performance gaming GPU into a thin and light notebook until we invented Max-Q. And in combination with our energy efficiency, we were able to -- we're now able to put a 2080 into a laptop, and it's still beautiful. And so this is effectively a brand-new growth market for us. And with so few people and so few gamers in the world that are able to game on a laptop, I think this is going to be a nice growth market for us.
And then the new market that we introduced and launched this last quarter is called RTX Studio. And this is an underserved segment of the market where consumers, enthusiasts, they could be artists that are working on small firms, they need powerful computers to do their work. They need powerful computers to do rendering and high-definition video editing. And yet it's underserved by workstations because workstations are really sold on a B2B basis into large enterprises. And so we aligned all of the OEMs and created a whole new line of notebooks called RTX Studio. And the enthusiasm has been great. We've launched 27 different laptops, and I'm looking forward to seeing the results of that. This is tens of millions of people who are creators. Some of them professionals, some of them hobbyists. And they use Adobe suites, they use Autodesk in their suites and some of them use SolidWorks and some of them use all kinds of renders, like blender. And these are 3D artists and video artists, and this digital content creation is the modern way of creativity. And so this is an underserved market that we're excited to go serve with RTX Studio.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And your last question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have 2 for Colette. My first question is on data center. So I know you say that you have a broad-based growth except for a few hyperscalers. But you only grew at 3% sequentially, about $20 million. That doesn't sound like broad-based growth to me unless like -- did the hyperscalers get worse? Or are they just still so much bigger than like the rest of it? I guess, what's going on in data center? How do I wrap my head around like broad-based growth with relatively minimal growth observed?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress, NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So to answer your question here, Stacy, on what we refer to when we're discussing the broad-based growth is the substantial expansion that we have on the types of customers and the industries that we are now approaching. As you know, even a year ago, we had a very, very small base in terms of industry-based hyper -- excuse me, industry-based AI workloads that they were using. Over this last quarter, we're continuing to see strong growth as we roll out all different types of AI solutions, both across the U.S. and worldwide, to these overall customers. Our hyperscalers, again, a couple of them, not necessarily growing. Some of them are flat and some of them are growing depending on whether or not that's for cloud instances or whether or not they're using it for internal use. So we believe that our continued growth with the industries is important for us for the long term to expand the use of AI, and we're just really pleased with what we're seeing in that growth this quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, everyone. We're happy with our results this quarter and our return to growth across our platforms. Gaming is doing great. It's great to see NVIDIA RTX reinvigorating the industry. GeForce has several growth drivers. Ray traced games continue to gain momentum. A large number of gaming laptops are rolling out, and our new Studio platform is reaching the large underserved community of creators. Outside a few hyperscalers, we're seeing broad-based growth in data centers. AI is the most powerful technology force of our time and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. More and more enterprises are using AI to create new products and services while leveraging AI to drive ultra-efficiency and speed in their business. And with hyperscalers racing to harness recent breakthroughs in conversational AI, we see growing engagements in training as well as interactive conversational inference. RTX, CUDA accelerated computing, AI, autonomous vehicles, the work we're doing is important, impactful and incredibly fun. We're just grateful there is so much of it. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. We're off to a strong start in fiscal 2020, delivering $33 billion in revenue this quarter. Our commercial cloud business continues to grow at scale as we work alongside the world's leading companies to help them build their own digital capability. Microsoft provides a differentiated technology stack spanning application infrastructure, data and AI, developer tools and services, security and compliance, business process, productivity and collaboration. For each of these areas -- first, each of these areas represents secular long-term growth opportunity. Second, we are delivering best-in-class innovation and openness in each layer. And third, we offer unparalleled integration and architectural coherence across the entire stack to meet the real-world needs of our customers.
Now I'll briefly highlight how we are accelerating our progress and innovation starting with Azure. Organizations today need a distributed computing fabric to meet their real-world operational sovereignty and regulatory needs. This quarter, we opened a new -- new data center regions in Germany and Switzerland. And in India, we are bringing the power of Microsoft Cloud to millions of small businesses through our partnership with Jio, one of the largest mobile carriers in the country.
Every Fortune 500 customer today is on a cloud migration journey, and we are making it faster and easier. Just this week, we announced an extensive go-to-market partnership with SAP, making Azure the preferred destination for every SAP customer. And our partnerships with VMware and Oracle also bring these ecosystems to our cloud.
We're extending beyond the cloud to the edge, enabling customers to get real-time insights where data is generated while ensuring security and privacy. And we are seeing traction in every industry, from Azure Sphere securely connecting Starbucks coffee machines to Azure Stack enabling scenarios from smart factories and modern compliant banking to mobile health care in remote areas.
We're reimagining customers' data estates for the cloud era with new limitless capabilities. Azure SQL Database brings hyperscale capabilities to relational databases and Azure Cosmos DB, the low-latency, high-availability database for globally distributed applications of any data type.
The quintessential characteristic of every application going forward will be AI, and we have the most comprehensive portfolio of AI tools, infrastructure and services. Azure AI now has more than 20,000 customers, and more than 85% of the Fortune 100 companies are using Azure AI in the last 12 months.
In health care, Novartis chose Azure AI to transform how medicines are discovered, developed and commercialized. Nuance will rely on our cloud to power the patient exam room of the future where clinical documentation writes itself, and Humana is using Azure AI to build personalized health care solutions for its more than 10 million members.
We're also pushing the bounds of how computers and AI can generalize learning beyond narrow domains, collaborating with open AI on a supercomputing platform to train and run AI models. I'm excited about our partnership and our collective pursuit to democratize AI and its benefits for everyone.
Now to developer tools. The rise of digital IP creation in every organization means developers will increasingly drive and influence every business process and function, and GitHub is where they go to learn, share and collaborate. GitHub has grown to more than 40 million developers, up more than 30% since our acquisition a year ago, and more than 2 million organizations use GitHub, including the majority of the Fortune 50. At Ford Motor Company alone, 8,000 employees use GitHub to innovate and collaborate with the vast ecosystem of third-party software developers. Our acquisition of Symantec code analysis engine family this quarter strengthens our security capabilities, enabling developers to more easily find vulnerabilities in large open source code bases.
Now let's turn to our workflow cloud, Power Platform. Automating workflows across every function will be key to productivity gains for every organization. We are building Power Platform as the extensibility framework for both Microsoft 365 inclusive of Microsoft Teams as well as Dynamics 365. It brings together low code, no code app development; robotic process automation; and self-service analytics, enabling everyone in an organization to build an intelligent app or workflow where none exist. Power Platform already has more than 2.5 million monthly active seasoned developers. Power Apps helps domain experts, those closest to the business problem, to design, build and publish custom apps fast, and 84% of the Fortune 500 have already created Power applications.
Now let's talk about security. Rising cyber threats and increasing regulation means security and compliance on a strategic priority for every organization. We have a comprehensive offering across identity, security and compliance spanning people, devices, apps, developer tools, data and infrastructure to protect customers in today's zero-trust environment. It starts with Azure active directory premium used by more than 100,000 organizations for identity, access management and SaaS application security across heterogeneous environments. It builds with information protection and cloud security with Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection and now with risk-based vulnerability management. And it extends to Azure Sentinel, now broadly available. Sentinel is a cloud-first service that analyzes security signal at massive scale across the entire organization using AI to detect, investigate and automatically remediate threats. We'll share more about our expanding opportunity in security at our Ignite conference in the next few weeks.
Now onto business applications. Dynamics 365 is the only AI-powered business cloud that gives customers a 360-degree view of their business from marketing and sales to finance and operations to unify data and unlock insights. It enables every level of organization to move from reactive silo transactional processes to proactive, repeatable and predictable business outcomes.
This quarter, we introduced Dynamics 365 Commerce, a new omni-channel solution to unify back-office, in-store and digital experiences and deliver personalized content wherever shoppers are. Dynamics 365 AI insights app ingest data from any first-party or third-party source, freeing data from systems of record to power modern systems of engagement and intelligence. New Dynamics 365 Product Insights provides organizations like Ecolab real-time view of how customers are using their products to maximize customer lifetime value. And Dynamics 365 Connected Store helps retailers select Marks & Spencer analyze observational data to optimize in-store shopping experience.
We're enabling our customers to bridge the physical and digital business processes with our mixed reality cloud, spanning HoloLens 2, Azure mixed reality services and Dynamics 365 applications. Pharmaceutical company, Patheon, for example, is using Dynamics 365 Guides along with HoloLens 2 to reimagine training for its employees.
Now to LinkedIn. We saw record levels of engagement again this quarter across the platform. Marketing solutions remains our fastest-growing segment, up 44% year-over-year as marketeers leverage our community-based tools to connect with LinkedIn's nearly 660 million members. We continue to innovate across our talent portfolio, including Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, Glint, LinkedIn Learning, to help every organization attract, retain and develop best talent. LinkedIn skills assessment is a new way for members to showcase their proficiencies and become more discoverable to recruiters.
Now turning to Microsoft 365 and Surface. Earlier this month, we unveiled our broadest Surface line up to date, including 2 new dual-screen devices coming next year. We are reimagining every layer with how we infuse AI from silicon up to device form factors and the role of operating systems to help people be more productive and creative in a multi-sense, multi-device world. We will continue to invest across form and function to new create categories that benefit our entire OEM ecosystem. And our expanded partnership with Samsung builds on our promise to help people be more productive on any device anywhere, bringing OneDrive, Outlook and Your Phone and more to new Samsung devices.
Microsoft 365 is the world's productivity cloud and the only comprehensive solution that empowers everyone from the C suite to first-line workers with an integrated secure work -- secure experience on any device. We're infusing AI across Microsoft 365 to help make work more intuitive and natural. New Presenter Coach in PowerPoint makes anyone a better public speaker. New capabilities in Word enable professionals to transcribe or record audio files while staying in the flow. Video is more searchable, shareable and first class within Microsoft 365 with Stream. And new inking capabilities let users create and reply to comments from anywhere using pen or voice.
Microsoft Teams continues to gain traction, bringing together everything a team needs: chat, voice, meetings, collaboration with the power of Office and business process workflow into a single integrated user experience, all with the highest security and compliance. Teams keeps all of your work, conversations and meetings in context, eliminating the need to bounce back and forth between different apps with features like integrated calendaring, one touch to join meetings from your phone. And we are broadening our opportunity with 2 billion first-line workers worldwide, adding priority notifications, role-specific targeted messages and the ability to clock in and cloud out of a shift. Our differentiated offering is driving usage making Teams the category leader. More than 350 organizations now have more than 10,000 users of Teams.
More broadly, all this innovation is fueling growth. Office 365 Commercial monthly active users surpassed 200 million this quarter. The leading organizations like Cerner, Chevron and the LEGO group are choosing our premium Microsoft 365 E5 offerings for their advanced security and productivity experiences.
Finally, gaming. In gaming, we are investing in content, community and cloud services to expand our opportunity with 2 billion gamers worldwide. We saw record Xbox Live monthly active users with strength both on and off console in mobile and PC and continued growth for Game Pass subscriptions. Gears 5 saw more than 3 million players in its first weekend alone. 10 years in, Minecraft is stronger than ever with record revenue and usage, and we are bringing the franchise to new audiences with Minecraft Earth. Finally, just last week, we started trials of Project xCloud, so gamers can play games wherever and whenever they want on any device.
In closing, we are accelerating our innovation across the entire technology stack to deliver new value for customers. We're investing aggressively in large markets with significant growth potential, and it's still early days.
With that, I'll hand over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.

Amy E. Hood, Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $33.1 billion, up 14% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 20% in constant currency. Operating income increased 27% and 32% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $1.38, increasing 21% and 25% in constant currency. Consistent execution and strong demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings drove a solid start to the fiscal year with another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth.
From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strengths across all markets. In our commercial business, we again saw increased customer commitment across our cloud platform. In Azure, we had material growth in the number of $10 million-plus contracts. Additionally, Microsoft 365 drove new customer adoption as well as expansion in our existing customer base given the strong value Office 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility and Security provide as a secure intelligent solution. As a result, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 30% and 35% in constant currency with a higher volume of new business and strong renewal execution.
Commercial annuity mix increased to 91%, and commercial unearned revenue was ahead of expectations at $31.1 billion, up 14% and 16% in constant currency. Our commercial remaining performance obligation was $86 billion, up 26% and 27% in constant currency driven by these long-term customer commitments. As a reminder, going forward, we will disclose the commercial remaining performance obligation as a KPI, which better reflects commitments our customers are making across all contract types.
Commercial cloud revenue was $11.6 billion, growing 36% and 39% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points year-over-year to 66%, a significant improvement in Azure gross margin, offset a sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, up 3 points year-over-year and ahead of our expectations driven by sales mix to higher-margin businesses.
The U.S. dollar was a bit weaker than anticipated, which resulted in slightly less impact to our results. FX reduced revenue growth by less than 2 points and COGS and operating expenses growth by approximately 1 point. Operating expenses grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, slightly lower than expectations, mainly driven by the timing of marketing and project spend. And operating margins expanded this quarter driven by the combination of higher gross margins and operating leverage through effective resource allocation.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11.1 billion, increasing 13% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by our on-premises Office Commercial business. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 15% in constant currency and benefited approximately 2 points from the transactional strength in Japan. Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 25% and 28% in constant currency was again driven by installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. Office 365 Commercial seats increased 21% with a growing mix from our Microsoft 365 suite.
Office Consumer revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency with roughly 7 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan, more than offsetting the strong prior year comparable related to the launch of Office 2019. Office 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 35.6 million.
Dynamics revenue grew 14% and 16% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 41% and 44% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 26% in constant currency with continued strength across all businesses. LinkedIn sessions increased 22% as engagement again reached record levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year as improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins more than offset an increase in cloud revenue mix.
Operating expenses increased 8% and 9% in constant currency driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 23% and 27% in constant currency.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $10.8 billion, increasing 27% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by our on-premises server business. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 30% and 33% in constant currency driven by continued demand from our hybrid value. Azure revenue increased 59% and 63% in constant currency with strong growth in our consumption-based business across all customer segments partially offset by further moderation in our per user business.
Our enterprise mobility installed base grew 36% to over 120 million seats, benefiting from the Microsoft 365 suite momentum. And our on-premises server business grew 12% and 14% in constant currency driven by continued strength across our hybrid and premium offerings, GitHub, and roughly 4 points of benefit from the end of support for SQL and Windows Server 2008.
Enterprise services revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency driven by growth in premier support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 30% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was up slightly as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin was partially offset by a growing mix if Azure, IaaS and PaaS revenue.
Operating expenses increased 22% driven by ongoing engineering and sales investments in cloud and AI, including GitHub. Operating income grew 33% and 38% in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $11.1 billion, increasing 4% and 5% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better-than-expected performance in our OEM Pro and Windows Commercial businesses more than offset lower-than-expected monetization across third-party titles within gaming.
In Windows, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 7%, below the consumer PC market with continued pressure in the entry-level category. OEM Pro revenue grew 19%, ahead of the commercial PC market driven by strong Windows 10 demand and momentum in advance of the Windows 7 end of support. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range.
Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 26% and 29% in constant currency driven by healthy demand for Microsoft 365, which carries higher in-quarter revenue recognition.
Surface revenue declined 4% and 2% in constant currency driven by the timing of product life cycle transitions ahead of the recently announced product launches. Search revenue ex TAC increased 11% and 13% in constant currency driven by Bing rate growth.
In gaming, revenue declined 7% and 6% in constant currency driven by lower console sales. Xbox content and services revenue was relatively unchanged and increased 1% in constant currency with growth from Minecraft, Gears of War 5 and Game Pass subscriptions offset by a strong third-party title in the prior year.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 4 points due to higher-margin sales mix. Operating expenses declined 7% and 6% in constant currency as redeployment of engineering resources to higher-growth opportunities was partially offset by investments in gaming. As a result, operating income grew 28% and 31% in constant currency.
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $4.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year driven by ongoing investment to meet growing demand for our cloud services and slightly below expectations due to normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Cash paid for PP&E was $3.4 billion.
Cash flow from operations was $13.8 billion and increased 1% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by tax payments related to the Q4 transfer of intangible property. Free cash flow was $10.4 billion and increased 4%. Excluding the impact of these tax payments, cash flow from operations and free cash flow grew 27% and 39%, respectively.
As expected, in other income and expense, interest income was offset by interest expense, foreign currency remeasurement and recognized losses on investments. Our effective tax rate was 16%, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $7.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 28% year-over-year.
Now let's move to our outlook. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 2 points; total company, Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing revenue growth by approximately 1 point and have no impact on total company COGS and operating expenses growth. We expect another strong quarter in our commercial business. Demand for our hybrid offerings and cloud services remain strong, and capital expenditures will continue to reflect that.
Given the normal variability and infrastructure spend timing, we expect Q2 CapEx spend to be down slightly on a sequential basis but still growing from the prior year. And commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to improve on a year-over-year basis even with the continued mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services.
Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion driven by double-digit growth across Office Commercial, Dynamics and LinkedIn. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $11.25 billion and $11.45 billion. In Azure, we expect continued strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per user business given the size of the installed base.
Our on-premises server business will be driven by demand for our hybrid and premium solutions as well as the continued benefit from increased demand ahead of the end of support for Windows Server 2008. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $12.6 billion and $13 billion. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should again be ahead of the PC market as we balance healthy Windows 10 demand and the benefit from the upcoming end of support for Windows 7 with the supply chain's ability to meet this demand in Q2. Based on our customer demand signal and prior end-of-support cycles, we expect some continued momentum past January, end-of-support deadline. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, we expect another strong quarter, benefiting from continued Microsoft 365 momentum.
In Surface, the launch of the latest Surface Pro and Surface laptop devices should drive low double-digit revenue growth on a strong prior year comparable. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth similar to Q1. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-20% range driven by lower console sales as we near the end of this generation as well as the most challenging quarterly comparable and third-party titles from last year.
Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion and operating expenses of $10.8 billion to $10.9 billion. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income is partially offset by interest and finance lease expense. And finally, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be slightly above the full year rate of 17%.
Now let me share some additional comments on the full year. At the company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth driven by continued momentum in our commercial business. Given our strong first quarter results and the expected sales mix for the remainder of the year, we now expect operating margins to be up slightly year-over-year even as we continue to invest with significant ambition in high-growth areas.
With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very nice quarter. I was hoping to dig in a little bit into the Intelligent Cloud business and what you guys are seeing there from a hybrid perspective. So maybe one question for Satya and one for Amy. For Satya, can you talk to us a little bit about sort of how these hybrid engagements are kind of rolling out with the largest customers, how they're contracting from it? And any sense you can give us in terms of in what way do they engage both kind of the on-premise assets as well as the cloud assets? Because I think that's part of the equation that's really positively surprising a lot of investors in how well server and tools is doing. And maybe for Amy, you could help us understand, sort of when we look at server and tools up 14% in constant currency, which is well ahead of our expectations, how should we think about the durability of that in terms of what comes from sort of the pull forward of demand ahead of some -- like SQL Server and Windows Server expirations and what is going to be more durable over time on the back of those pull forwards.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, Keith. Thanks for the question. Overall, our approach has always been about this distributed computing fabric or thinking about hybrid as not as some transitory phase but as a long-term vision for how computing will meet the real-world needs because if you think about the long term, compute will migrate to wherever data is getting generated. And increasingly, there'll be data generated in the real world where just -- when you think about the cloud, you have to think about the edge of the cloud as a very first-class construct. And so in that context, the -- what we see is a couple of things that you see even in the results today. One is the hybrid benefit that is increasingly what is getting customers excited about the Azure choice and the fact that they can renew knowing that they have the flexibility of both the cloud and the edge. That's definitely driving growth.
Second is we're also gaining share. When you think about what's happening even in the edge, some of the -- our data center edition products are very competitive in the marketplace. And so you see both of those effects. But architecturally, we feel well placed. In fact, at our Ignite Conference, you'll see us even take the next leap forward even in terms of how we think about the architecture inclusive of the application models, programming models on what distributed computing looks like going forward. So we feel well positioned there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood, Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And Keith, to your question on durability, we tried to call out the 4 points that we felt transactionally was due to the end of support, and that's 4 of the 12 in USD. And so -- but for us, if you step back for a second, the durable trends that Satya just talked about, which is making sure we license in a way that respects this long-term reality of where data and compute will be needed is what we call the hybrid value proposition. And the rights to that, of course, are inherent in how we report this number. And so for us, what you'll see is premium strength, which we saw this quarter in both SQL and Windows because of some of the value proposition of hybrid and of course, broad strength as well when people feel that flexibility to not be constrained by licensing in terms of how they view their estate.

Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Anne Bellini, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD & Analyst [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a question for Amy. I was just wondering, you've been saying for a while now that you're seeing material improvements in Azure gross margins and that's obviously hugely benefited commercial cloud gross margin. I'm just wondering if you could share with us how much of the improvement is related to the need to maybe expand data centers at a lower clip than you have been. Maybe it's less depreciation and amortization that's coming -- that you're starting to recognize. How much of it is due to just better capacity utilization then? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much longer you're going to be able to say that for I guess. And just have you guys been ratcheting up your target gross margins for Azure over the years to where you think they could be as you look ahead?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood, Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Heather. Let me start by saying, in general, at the commercial cloud gross margin, what you're seeing is revenue growth that, for the past almost 2 years, has vastly been faster than our capital expenditure growth. So if you start at the top of the frame, what we're seeing is overall gross margin improvement across portfolio and improving -- and that comes from a couple of things, which is where you're getting to on Azure. It comes from structural improvement on sort of cost per unit, but it also comes from mix shift of revenue to premium services, from being able to sell more SaaS-like services and consumption services or even premium data services that really do have both more margin but also are quite consistent in terms of their growth. And you see then that represented as improving targets for us.
But I would say in general, Heather, what the team has done is actually delivered on what I think we felt was a 5-year road map of improving gross margins on a material basis. Now as you continue to see the mix shift to the consumption-based Azure services, the overall cloud gross margin will improve at the same rate. And we've said that, and you'll continue to see that on a go-forward basis as well. But we do continue to expect Azure, especially on the consumption side gross margins, to improve. And they still have room to improve, especially as we start to see some of these premium services both being made available and being utilized at higher rates.

Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karl Emil Keirstead, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amy, question for you. When I look at your next quarter guidance by revenue segment, it seems to equate to an overall revenue growth rate assuming the midpoint of about 9% to 10%. So when I combine that with the 14% growth you just put up in Q1, it implies that, in the second half, overall Microsoft revenue growth should remain roughly in the 10% zip code to enable you to get to double-digit growth for the full year despite the fact that you're moving past some fairly key end-of-support milestones. I think some of us were expecting a little bit more of a first half, second half delta. So I just wanted to ask you what are the maybe 1 or 2 or 3 drivers that enable you to sustain that growth rate in the second half and if it's fair to assume that your guidance doesn't really reflect any deterioration in the overall spending environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood, Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. I think in general, Karl, a couple of things I would point to or many of the things I talked about in the comments that we prepared, overall, Q1 was a very strong start commercially from a bookings perspective with some very strong trends across the board. Whether it is in both the absolute size and number of the Azure commitments that we're seeing, the consistency we're seeing in the consumption growth rates of Azure, the commitments we're seeing to Microsoft 365, some of the signs we're seeing across our Dynamics, the Power Platform, the workflow cloud that Satya referred to and LinkedIn, it's a good bookings quarter, a good execution quarter on overall contracting value. Renewals were good, recapture rates were good, and new business was good.
So with that confidence, some of those same trends that we had talked about, of course, show up through the year. And we've tried to be consistent in that while end of support will make for points here and there each quarter, the more sustainable trends are the fact that our commercial cloud overall offers significant value and differentiation to customers and are making longer-term commitments and we continue to grow ARPU. So when I think about sort of some of the seasonality that you're talking about, Q2, I felt we were -- I wanted to be clear that that's really a gaming challenge in Q2, and you see that reflected in the margins in Q2 being significantly better than they were last Q2. And if you think about H2, I do expect Surface will have some easier comparables in H2 and a new portfolio to grow from. So I think that's another change you'll see in trajectory in H2 as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark L. Moerdler, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Congrats on the quarter. AI is obviously a large focus. It was a large driver of Intelligent Cloud OpEx spending growth this quarter. Satya, can you give us some more color on where you see Microsoft on the AI journey? And Amy, is this investing way ahead of revenue? Or is AI already driving big revenue for Azure? How should we think about it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Mark. It's a great question because we look at what's happening with AI having 2 dimensions to it. One is I would say just our own use of AI as first-party SaaS applications. There's some phenomenal breakthroughs. When you see new transcription features or new computer vision features that come with HoloLens, all of these are being driven by new AI capabilities. They're all, by the way, powered by the same cloud infrastructure. We all build everything at Microsoft with first party equals third party with Azure as the core platform. So what you see us is, in fact, using our own SaaS applications and consumer innovation even to drive the high-end AI capability but then bring the best-in-class tooling for enterprise customers. So for example, like we have innovated even in what does DevOps look like for the machine learning age. That's a unique capability that's there in Azure ML. And those are the types of innovations that are even driving the projects that enterprise customers have on Azure. So you'll see us leverage our overall spend, whether it's CapEx or OpEx across all of what Microsoft does and then surface them in, I think, what is perhaps the best way to get traction in the enterprise market, which is great tooling, compliance, security. And that's a place where we are making good progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood, Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And so for me, Mark, it's a little bit hard for me to say, gosh, we invest in AI here and you'll see it specifically here. What I think you heard through Satya's commentary is actually AI woven through every layer and component of the entire tech stack and how important that is, whether you're participating at the Dynamics 365 layer with insights or whether you're using components like some of our customers are maybe for a natural interaction work. And so for me, it is almost fundamental to see that cost and investment because you'll see it in margin and usage and frankly, product differentiation that we can provide versus our competitors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brent John Thill, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amy, there's been a lot of macro concern among tech investors given some of the peers in your group that have seen some weakness. It doesn't seem that you have seen anything, but I'm curious if you could just comment on what you're seeing from a demand perspective.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood, Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Brent. What I would say is, for us, it has been so important to remain focused on where growth and opportunity exist and to invest in those areas that are large, expansive and durable TAMs. And I think when you think about where we've spent our time, both building products, investing in marketing, investing in sales capability and technical capability, it has been in many, if not all, of those places. So when I look and say where is our execution or how do I think about our ability to execute in a macro environment, for me, it is about investing in the right places, executing in a great way, remaining focused on the transition our customers need us to help them through to create their own opportunity and their own growth. And I think we've done a nice job of being invested in the right places. Satya mentioned a few of them on the call, but there are really many. If you think about security, compliance, communication, workflow, business process reinvention, the list can go on and on where I feel like we have set up a multiyear journey to be well positioned. And I tend to think of every quarter, every year as an opportunity to continue to differentiate, invest in innovation and execute well to take share. And so that's, I think, how I've approached that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And I think that's probably the unifying theme, quite frankly, of all the questions so far, which is what's next. What's next for us is in the apps and infra go from perhaps first inning to second innings; for data and AI, to start the first innings. When it comes to security, compliance, we never participated in this. Guess what? We get to participate in a fairly competitive way now. We have built for something that didn't even exist a few years ago, which is the workflow cloud. That's a huge opportunity for us. Biz apps, we are a very competitive and growing footprint. Even when we think about something like Microsoft 365, we never participated in spite of our past success with all the first-line work, and now we get to participate in it. So I see long-term secular growth opportunities, and we want to stay focused on making sure our innovation is competitive in all those layers we talked about.

Operator [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Alan Winslow, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Congrats on another really impressive quarter. Satya, I want to focus on the strategic announcements you talked about earlier in the call, Oracle, VMware and obviously, the most recent one with SAP. Wondering if you would just walk us through the sort of the strategic thoughts behind these. And then also especially with VMware and Oracle since those have been out there obviously longer, what's the feedback from customers been? And then I guess to Amy, how do you think about sort of these big strategic [offices] this year actually showing up in the numbers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, Phil. Thanks. So overall, I think this is again one of those things where, in the past, we participated in the infrastructure business, but we had a fairly narrow footprint, which is we had our own infrastructure that supported primarily our databases and our operating systems. Whereas with the migration to the cloud, customers are looking for us to be a provider of all their infrastructure needs, which is heterogeneous. And that's what has really led us at the infrastructure layer to have partnerships with VMware and Oracle. We, as you know, have first-class support for Windows and Linux, Java and .NET, Postgres and SQL, VMware, Red Hat as well as obviously Windows hypervisor.
So we -- I feel that we now have that ability to be able to take the entire infrastructure estate, the entire data estate and really add value with these partnerships. And SAP represents the same because SAP has got both infrastructure. We now are the preferred cloud, so I think it's a fairly no-brainer for any customer who's an SAP customer who wants to accelerate their migration to the cloud and innovation from SAP and us that they should move to Azure, and that's what this announcement was all about. And so we're really looking forward to essentially executing on that strategy and that customer need that we see very clearly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood, Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And Phil, to your question on where would we see this, you'd actually see it in a couple of places, not just in Azure, which may, in fact, be the most logical extension. But at the heart of this is making it easier, faster and more reliable for us to help customers move their estate to the cloud and to migrate that with confidence. And so when we do that, it's about becoming a committed partner. And you actually see that in broader Microsoft Cloud results, whether that's helping even through these partnerships to be able and get closer to Tier 1 workloads, business process changes. And so I actually think these are quite important for us to continue to make sure the first goal is customer centric, which is why we continue to move in this direction.

Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jennifer Alexandra Swanson Lowe, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think this is probably an Amy question. As I sort of parse through the Dynamics within Office 365 and through the discussion around sustainability of double-digit growth within the commercial segment, we've seen seat count decelerate. Also, the uplift on pricing maybe isn't as much this quarter as we saw in the past, which leads me to believe that you are seeing a lot of success in the front-line worker piece and maybe that's a bigger driver of the seat count from here. But can you just -- and at the same time, you're seeing strong uptake of the premium SKUs as well. But as we think about seat count going forward, how much opportunity is there still left on the migration front of commercial licenses versus leaning a bit more on things like front-line worker to sustain outgrowth? And is there a point where potentially the seat growth and things like frontline could start to eat further into your ability to continue to lift ARPU on the base you already have?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood, Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Jen. Let me break this question apart because you're actually asking important dynamics that I don't always think of as trade-off, and so I want to make that more clear in my answer. First, to your question on seat growth, we have room even beyond just first-line workers. Whether that is our ability in small- and mid-sized businesses, on a global basis with mobile-first workers, this is a very broad opportunity for us to reach people trying to accomplish tasks and do their work on devices of any size. And so there is significant room for us to continue to make progress on that front.
Now could that end up with some ARPU pressure long term? It certainly could, but the important -- for me, I don't think of that as being necessarily a negative. We used to really make no money through these seats that we just talked about. And so every dollar or multiple dollars or many dollars earned on those new seats is all new revenue, new opportunity and new socket for us. Let me separate that from the next dynamic, which is why sort of an average number may not be the best indication, which is our ability to continue to move people to higher-value SKUs, whether that's through the addition of really compelling things in security or compliance or communications or collaboration or knowledge or learning, where we can add value. Whether we call that E5 or E3, we have room in that transition as well and new opportunity in a way that I'm not sure I've seen us. I feel very optimistic about M365 -- I'm sorry, Microsoft 365 and our ability to continue to add value. So hopefully that helps, Jen.

Our last question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raimo Lenschow, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Analyst [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick question on Azure. If I look at the SAP announcements, but you had some other industry announcements out there as well like Humana, et cetera, like how do I have to think about the progress you guys are making here in terms of getting more into the different industries and to kind of create deeper relationships around Azure rather than just doing kind of simple infrastructure outsourcing?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. It's a very deliberate strategy that we have. In meeting our customers' needs, we need to have the partners they already work with and want to work with also on our platform. So it starts sometimes with the customers, whether it's Humana or Walgreens or Walmart and others. It also starts with partners like Nuance, which is another one that we announced recently. And so the idea is for us to be really ensuring that by every industry we have the right marquee customers as well as the partners and have strong go to markets.
One of the things that everyone, I think, in the marketplace understands is Microsoft, especially from a partner perspective, is a great route to market. We have a platform directly with our sales force as well as our channel that is very attractive to third-party developers to get on Azure and they've realized those benefits. And in fact, our customers rely on that also as a benefit because it helps them get the best value from their partners as well.

Michael Spencer, Microsoft Corporation - General Manager of IR [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.

Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all of those listening in today. First quarter revenue increased 18% from a year ago to $984 million based on growth across both of our business segments. Gross margin also improved, driven largely by the success of our recently launched Ryzen CPUs. I am pleased with our first quarter product execution and improved year-over-year financial results, which demonstrate the revenue growth and gross margin expansion potential with our strong set of new products.
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment. We delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth. Strong demand for Ryzen CPUs and improved GPU sales resulted in CG revenue increasing 29% from the year-ago period. CG revenue declined 1% sequentially, which was better-than-normal seasonality as significant growth in desktop processor sales, driven by the first month of Ryzen CPU sales, largely offset seasonal declines in GPU and notebook APU sales.
Solid demand for our family of premium Ryzen 7 processors, including our flagship Ryzen 7 1800X offering, which is the industry's highest performance 8-core CPU, drove our highest desktop processor revenue in more than 2 years. Ryzen CPUs have been consistently ranked among the top-selling processors at global e-tailers and retailers. And press reviews and end-user sentiment have highlighted the strong performance and value proposition.
In early April, we launched our enthusiast-class Ryzen 5 processors and received overwhelmingly positive reviews that demonstrate our multi-threaded leadership and unmatched value proposition.
The Ryzen CPU partner ecosystem also continues to strengthen. We have seated more than 300 software developers to support their work optimizing for Ryzen CPUs and have already seen double-digit performance gains across a number of top-tier gaming titles. Last week, the first Ryzen-based OEM gaming desktops were announced, and we continue the rapid rollout of Ryzen-powered systems with additional launches planned for major OEMs later this quarter.
In Graphics, GPU sales increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago based on growth across all of our product lines. The ramp of Polaris-based notebook design wins drove increased mobile GPU sales while our desktop growth was led by improved channel sales.
In early Q2, we launched 4 new Radeon RX 500 GPUs, featuring our Polaris architecture that deliver improved performance. These new mainstream GPUs provide a compelling solution for the millions of gamers looking to upgrade their PCs to support advanced display technologies and deliver optimal gaming experiences.
We also saw higher professional graphics revenue from a year ago, driven by expanding channel sales and growing data center wins, as we continue to increase our GPU-compute footprint with leading cloud service providers.
We remain on track to launch the first products from our next-generation Radeon Vega family later this quarter. Vega is a forward-looking architecture that combines a revolutionary memory subsystem, next-generation compute engine, advanced pixel engine and new geometry pipeline to dramatically improve performance and energy efficiency for the next generation of GPU workloads. Customer excitement is building as we focus on bringing significant competition to the high-end GPU space across the PC gaming, professional design and GPU compute markets.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue increased 5% from a year ago, driven by the latest game console offerings from Sony and Microsoft and our third straight quarter delivering year-on-year embedded revenue growth. We see solid demand for our latest FinFET-based semi-custom offerings in 2017, including the planned holiday launch of Microsoft's 4K-focused Project Scorpio console featuring a new AMD SoC.
On the data center front, in March, we demonstrated that our upcoming Naples server CPU would offer more cores, I/O and memory bandwidth when compared to the highest-end dual socket x86 server CPUs currently available, resulting in better performance across multiple workloads.
Naples platform development work continued to accelerate in the quarter. We are in the final stages of preparation in advance of launch and are very pleased with the status of our silicon and customer engagements. We have now seated thousands of Naples processors across an extensive set of OEMs, end users and partners, and remain on track for our first Naples products to launch this quarter.
In closing, we started 2017 delivering significant year-on-year revenue growth and margin expansion based on solid product execution and strong market and customer reception to our new leadership products. Our focus in 2017 remains on launching our Naples server CPU with broad customer, partner and ecosystem support. Naples is the first step in our long-term plan to deliver a leadership data center product road map.
Complementing the success of our mainstream Polaris-based GPUs with our high-end Vega GPUs, extending our Zen core into the mainstream desktop and premium notebook markets with the launches of our Ryzen 3 CPUs and Ryzen mobile APUs in the second half of the year, and expanding our participation in the fast-growing market for GPU compute with the launch of Radeon Instinct accelerators midyear.
2017 is an important year for AMD, and we are well positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion based on bringing performance, choice and innovation to an expanding set of markets. I look forward to discussing more about our long-term strategy at our Financial Analyst Day later this month.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a good start to 2017 as we expanded gross margin, increased revenue 18% year-over-year to $984 million and reduced losses year-over-year.
Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased 29% year-over-year, driven by the launch of our high-performance Ryzen desktop processors and our strengthened GPU product portfolio. Our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue increased 5% from a year ago.
Let me provide some specifics for the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 34%, up 2 percentage points year-over-year, driven by a higher overall mix of revenue from our Computing and Graphics segment and a richer product mix within that segment, due to Ryzen desktop processor sales.
Operating expenses were $364 million compared to $332 million a year ago. The increase is due primarily to R&D investments in Graphics and our server business. Net licensing gain from our server JV with THATIC was $27 million compared to $7 million a year ago. Operating loss was $6 million in the first quarter of 2017, a significant improvement from a $55 million loss a year ago.
First quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $32 million, down from $41 million year-over-year, primarily due to a lower overall interest rate and a lower debt balance. Net loss was $38 million, or loss per share of $0.04 calculated using 939 million shares of common stock as compared to a net loss of $96 million or $0.12 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $28 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of negative $22 million from a year ago.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $593 million, up 29% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher Ryzen desktop, CPU and graphics processor sales. The better-than-seasonal quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to lower mobile and graphics processor sales, largely offset by Ryzen desktop processor sales.
Computing and Graphics business segment operating loss was $15 million, a significant improvement from a loss of $70 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher revenue.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $391 million, up 5% year-over-year, primarily due to higher semi-custom SoC sales. Operating income was $9 million, down from $16 million a year ago, due primarily to higher server-related R&D investments, largely offset by an increase in the THATIC JV licensing gain.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $943 million at the end of the quarter compared to $1.26 billion at the end of 2016. The sequential decrease was driven primarily by the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments and increased inventory.
Inventory ended at $839 million compared to $751 million at year-end in support of the ramp of new products and increased semi-custom SoC sales in the second quarter.
Long-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.41 billion, down from $1.44 billion at year-end, primarily due to debt reduction activities. The principal debt amount was $1.73 billion, down $34 million from the prior quarter as a result of debt reduction actions.
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter. We expect revenue to increase 17% sequentially plus or minus 3%, non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 33%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $370 million, licensing gain associated with our server JV to be approximately $20 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million, and inventory to be down sequentially.
For 2017, we now expect revenue to increase low double-digit percentage from a year-over-year basis and CapEx to be approximately $140 million, including the capitalization of production mask sets beginning in Q1 2017. Additional 2017 guidance can be found in the CFO commentary document.
In closing, we remain focused on continuing to improve our financial performance on the strength of new product introductions, continued financial discipline and ongoing strategic investments in the business. I look forward to sharing further details on our longer-term prospects at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day on May 16.
With that, I'll turn it back to Laura. Laura?

Laura Graves, - [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of our call.

================================================================================
Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew D. Ramsay, Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Principal and Senior Analyst [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lisa, I wonder if you could spend a little bit more time talking about the Ryzen desktop launch, how you would characterize that it's gone so far? Maybe any kind of quantification you can give on revenue for the 1 month you had in the first quarter and then for the second quarter guidance? And then anything that might have limited sales in the quarter. We heard things about, shortages of motherboards from the SKU suppliers, et cetera. So any kind of additional commentary around the Ryzen launch would be really helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, sure, absolutely, Matt. So, look, we're very pleased with how the Ryzen launch well -- went. It was a big launch for us. We did Ryzen 7 first in early March and then Ryzen 5 here in the middle of April. All of the feedback that we've gotten so far from both our customers and from end users has been very strong. I think the value proposition is very strong at both the Ryzen 7 8-core devices as well as the Ryzen 5 4- and 6-core devices. Relative to how it performed in the quarter, actually it performed as we expected. So with the global launch, we were reaching many distributors and many channel partners, and I think that's going well. We did see some early shortages in terms of motherboards, and that was our motherboard partners ramping their supply in line with our CPU supply. But that was really dissipated after the first couple of weeks. So nothing out of the ordinary there. So we feel really good about where it is. I think the important thing is as we go into the second quarter, we not only have the channel sales, but we also have the major OEMs that will be launching their systems in the second quarter. So I think that's the next piece of the Ryzen launch for us. But overall, I would say it went quite well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew D. Ramsay, Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Principal and Senior Analyst [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And just as my follow-up question, wanted to ask a little bit about gross margin. Lisa, you talked in your prepared remarks about as the new product roll out across the different parts of the company through the year that margins should expand. Yet your -- with a full quarter of Ryzen, you're guiding gross margin down slightly sequentially. I know the new gaming console business starts to ramp for the upcoming season in that quarter as well. So any kind of puts and takes around that gross margin? Because for some reaction I got from investors tonight that sequentially down gross margin surprised a couple of folks. So any clarification there would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Absolutely, Matt. So if you look at our gross margin progression, given the mix of our business, clearly we made actually very nice progress year-over-year. So if you look at Q1 2017 compared to Q1 2016, we expanded margin by 2 points and that was really on the strength of Ryzen. When you look sequentially, because of the mix of our business, game consoles were at the lowest point in the first quarter, and there will be a ramp of game consoles going into the second quarter. So the relative mix of the business sees more game consoles in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. So that's the reason for the sequential guidance. But again, if you look year-on-year, Q2 '17 to Q2 '16, you see again a nice margin expansion as a result of the strength of the products.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Clark Seymore, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wanted to follow up on the Ryzen launch, not only in the quarter, but also in the guide, and specifically, any color you could provide on the channel inventory, how that exited the quarter and what your plans are for adding or boiling down some of that inventory in Q2?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, So, sure, Ross. So as we go into the second quarter, we certainly are adding both the Ryzen 5 in addition to the Ryzen 7. So if we look at the forward guidance, up 17% quarter-on-quarter, that is driven by additional Ryzen as well as the semi-custom ramp that I just talked about. We are early in the ramp. Everything that we see is -- we're getting a positive reception throughout the ecosystem and we're going to continue with go-to-market activities and, as I mentioned, the OEM components of that will kick in, in the second quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Clark Seymore, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And I guess as my follow-up, 2 quick ones for Devinder. The inventory went up sequentially by about 11%, 12%. And you had an explanation for that, but if I recall right, you thought it'd be flat. So I'm just wondering what changed there? And then with the share count, I think as you approach breakeven, the share count might change. So any color you could give us on the share count going forward would be helpful as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why sure. And you're right about the inventory. The ramp of new products and especially the ramp of the semi-custom product revenue that Lisa just talked about was the main reason for the high inventory. We also had the opportunity in the quarter to put [those wafers] in Q1 ahead of Q2 sales and took advantage of the opportunity leading to the inventory at the $839 million. On the share count, you're right. As we go ahead and look at the share count on a basic share basis, we have 939 million, but there are 2 parts to it. If we were profitable, the warrants that we issued to Mubadala last year as part of the WSA, those get converted depending on the stock price, and that would be in there depending on profitability. And then the second thing is a convertible, obviously, as you know, how that works, is, if converted, then obviously those will be included in the share count, otherwise it will depend upon dilution or not, depending on the EPS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark John Lipacis, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perhaps a question for Lisa and one for Devinder. Lisa, can you talk about whether or not you're getting the right capacity and expected yields from your foundry as Ryzen launches? And for Devinder, as your customers take higher ASP processors in the game console business, I seem to remember when you originally launched, I thought that the -- maybe the initial yields or maybe the initial margins were not as good but the margins improved over time. And I'm wondering if, assuming I remembered properly, if that's something also we should be thinking about as your customers take the higher ASP game console processors?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, Mark. So on your first question, relative to the margins and how those look, I think they are -- the yields are as expected, so both the 16-nanometer and the 14-nanometer have done really well. And so in terms of the new product ramp, the yields are as expected and per our margin structure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, on the semi-custom, Mark, as far as the margins are concerned, you are referring to the operating margins, I think we're pretty pleased where we are. And it's a mix for us in terms of transition to some of the products, for example, the Sony PlayStation Pro that we launched sometime last year and obviously, the older game console that we launched in 2013. The ASPs do come down over time, although we are able to manage the cost down, too, and therefore, offsetting the ASP decline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, and, Mark, maybe just to finish off the comment. I think -- to your question, I think we feel pretty good about our cost structure. We're always going to continue to try to reduce the cost structure over time. But in terms of the margin expansion story as we go through the year, it's going to be about the mix of business. And as we get into the higher ASP, stronger product portfolio and that ramps to a larger piece of the business, that will be the margin expansion story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David M. Wong, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can you give us some idea of where Vega sits? Does it focus on the price points above Polaris? Or does it provide a refresh also within the lower price points where currently you have Polaris?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, absolutely, David. So Vega is really a new architecture, so it is focused on the price point above Polaris. We expect Vega to be a broad product for us that will go across the gaming segment, the professional workstation segment as well as GPUs in the data center, and we will be launching products across all of those segments with the Vega architecture in the next couple of months. So the Polaris refresh for us is the RX 500 series that we launched just a couple weeks ago. And that is what we would use in sort of those mainstream price points in 2017.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David M. Wong, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. And could you give us any specifics on when in the second half you expect to launch notebook and desktop processors [within cores] and integrated graphics?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, so we are on track to launch the rest of the Ryzen portfolio in PCs. We'll launched Ryzen 3 sort of earlier in the second half, and then we will launch our Ryzen mobile towards the holiday cycle for the second half.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the first one, I'm a little surprised on the [CSG] business, you said -- I mean, sales were roughly flat, sequentially, give or take. You said Ryzen sales made up for seasonally lower GPUs in notebooks we have -- should have materially lower margins. I'm just amazed -- I'm just very surprised that the loss in the business barely got any better. Can you give us some indication for where Ryzen margins are today versus the product that they're replacing? And give us a little bit of color on why the CPU margins didn't actually get much better just given the ramp?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Stacy, maybe let me start and see if Devinder has some comments to add. I think certainly the rise in gross margins are substantially better than the legacy portfolio. So I think that is true. I think when you look at the sequential, there was 1% sequential decline, and there was a $7 million or $8 million sequential improvement in operating loss. There was also some additional R&D in that segment as we're ramping up both product expenses as well as some sales and marketing and go-to-market expenses in the quarter. Yes, so overall, it was as we expected. Maybe, Devinder, do you want to add to that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I think the other thing I would add, Stacy, is on the Ryzen piece of it. The ASPs are better, the margins are better. And as you can see from a segment standpoint, we made some pretty good progress year-over-year from a viewpoint of the operating loss getting better or the results getting better year-over-year from a segment standpoint.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it. For my follow-up, I guess maybe it hints at the OpEx a little bit, but it looks like you're capitalizing your masks now. You took your CapEx side up by $60 million for the year. You went from $80 million to $140 million. Is that all the mask? And if so, were those mask costs actually in OpEx before? And if that's the case, have you actually taken your OpEx guide effectively up by $60 million for the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think, 2 parts to it. First of all, on the mask piece, okay, you're right. The mask costs, as our product development becomes profitable, I think the mass costs have gone up. Especially with the latest technology, we went ahead and decided to capitalize the production mask set cost. From a geographic standpoint, the mask costs, but as they would have been an R&D previously, would be sitting in the COGS side of the P&L, and therefore, amortized in the COGS side related to the production of the unit. And the difference in the CapEx guidance, $80 million to $100 million, and $40 million is primarily the max costs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it. So what does that mean for, I guess, how you guys are tackling gross margin now if they would have been directly in the COGS before, and now they're being capitalized over time? Is that a margin -- I guess, effective margin boost even though it's not anything on the cash side? And if so, I guess, the same question then, why are margins down this quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I think margins, as Lisa said earlier, year-on-year, we're pretty pleased with the progress, 2 percentage points up. Q2 is a mix of the business, and then as we get to the end of -- to the second of the year, we'll see the full impact of, not just the Ryzen product, but also both Naples product that's coming up at the tail end of Q2, and then maybe into the second half of 2017.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Stacy, maybe I just want to clarify because I want to make sure that we were clear. So the masks were in OpEx and now they're going to be capitalized as they go into production. So they weren't in COGS before.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you have effectively taken your OpEx up then, because it doesn't look like your OpEx is coming down by the same amount. So you're spending more?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I think it really is a full year statement, and I think it's a recognition of, as we transition from 14-nanometer to 7-nanometer, 7-nanometer masks are substantially more expensive than 14-nanometer. So I don't think you can exactly put it the way you put it. But I think -- overall, I think what we're trying to do is basically, as the masks sets becomes more sizable on the production level to capitalize them.

Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ambrish Srivastava, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research and Senior Research Analyst [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I actually wanted to just continue with the discussion on margins. So would the margin profile then as we exit the year, should we expect margins -- gross margins to trend up for the second half versus what you reported, i.e., or what you're guiding to, i.e., would that be the lowest point for the year? And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Ambrish, I think you should expect that we will expand margins as we go through the year. We do have this mix effect between semi-custom and new product revenue. But certainly, our exit velocity as we ended the year, we should see -- when you compare year-on-year sort of Q4 '17 to Q4 '16, you should see the margin expansion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ambrish Srivastava, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research and Senior Research Analyst [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, and then for my follow-up, in your full year guide, on the top line, now you're giving a -- you're quantifying it versus what you had before. I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity or to the extent you guys can share on the assumptions that you have baked in there for the various segments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, so the full year guide is low double-digit revenue growth, '17 to '16. I think, given our product portfolio being very much influenced by the PC -- the Ryzen in PCs, Vega for GPUs as well as Naples from a server standpoint, we expect that the Computing and Graphics segment will be -- will grow more so than the EESC segment overall on a year-over-year basis, just given some of the consumer markets move faster than some of the data center and server markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hans Carl Mosesmann, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lisa, can you give us a sense of the introduction of Naples into the second half and next year? Is that going to reflect or be similar to what you're doing with the Ryzen 7 and then 5 and then 3? And I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. So look, we're really pleased with where we are with the Naples program right now. Overall, from a performance standpoint of the product and the customer engagements, it's going as we would expect. We will launch here in the second quarter. So we'll start some low-volume of revenue shipments here in the second quarter that will ramp gradually into the second half of the year. And so overall, I think that is how the server outlook will be. I think I have said before, and I did still say, that the server market has a longer design win to revenue conversion cycle. And so we would expect it to take a couple quarters for us to ramp the Naples product over time. And you should see a number of customers announcing with AMD platforms over the next couple quarters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hans Carl Mosesmann, Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. And then as a follow-up on the server side, what's the strategy in terms of positioning of the product? I mean, traditionally, in most cases, it's been more of, like, a me-too product at the low end of the market. What's the strategy here? If you can share that with us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. So we believe we're highly differentiated with Naples in the sense that we have more cores, we have more memory bandwidth, we have more I/O than our competition. So for certain workloads, I think Naples is going to do very, very well, certainly, in the cloud as well as in certain HPC workloads and big data workloads that can use all of that memory and I/O bandwidth. We will be talking more about the positioning of Naples and the key workloads as we go through the next couple of months prior to launch. But certainly, we feel that it's, again, like Ryzen, on the strength of the Zen core, we have a very, very strong foundational product. And now it's about making sure that we help our customers get to market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Crédit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist, Global Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor/Semiconductor Capital Equipment Analyst [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, guys, can you hear me?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, John.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist, Global Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor/Semiconductor Capital Equipment Analyst [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lisa, can you hear me?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist, Global Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor/Semiconductor Capital Equipment Analyst [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Just quickly, Lisa, given that mix is now becoming quite important in trying to understand gross margin, I'd be kind of curious, what percent of your compute business in the March quarter was based on Ryzen? And I guess, if you assume that all of it transitions to Ryzen eventually, had that occurred in the March quarter, can you give us an understanding of how much better gross margins would have been? And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All right, John, that might be hard for me to answer very specifically. But let me give you the high-level view. So, look, we started selling Ryzen on March 2, and a good piece of it was basically for us positioning into the distributors. We take revenue on a sellout model, and so you should think about -- although we shipped a number of Ryzens, we didn't necessarily revenue them all in the quarter, just given that we're on a sellout model for our revenue recognition. In terms of where we are in the transition, Ryzen, non-Ryzen, we still have a long ways to go. I mean, the way you should think about it is Ryzen 7 was at the very high end. We're going to -- Ryzen 5 has started, we have Ryzen 3 that will come next and then we have the entire mobile portfolio as well. So it will take us through this year to really transition the majority of the product over to Ryzen. I think everything that we've seen, the ASP uplifts are definitely very beneficial. And so we're pleased with sort of the pricing that we're commanding for the product and the reception for the product. So I think it's just that it will take us a couple quarters to transition the overall portfolio over to Ryzen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist, Global Technology Sector Head, and Semiconductor/Semiconductor Capital Equipment Analyst [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, Lisa, as a follow-up to that, I know you guys are coming up with an Analyst Day next month and some of these targets might change. But to the extent that your old gross margin target was sort of 36% to 40%, I'm just kind of curious to what extent can you get to that sort of 38% midpoint just by moving your current market share mix towards Ryzen? And to what extent does getting to 38% or above imply either market share gains in the compute business on the desktop notebook side or on the server side? How do I think about that dynamic?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So the long-term guidance at 36% to 40%, I think we have multiple ways of getting there. Certainly, on the PC side, it is not anticipating that we gain a significant amount of share over our historical numbers. So I think the idea on the PC side is, again, I think 2017, a large percentage of the margin story is around PCs. I think as you go into 2018, you'll see a larger percentage of that be in servers. But to the fundamental question, I think we feel good that the mix dynamics are there, the product is strong enough to command the right ASPs that we can get to the long-term margin target several different ways.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lisa, for my first one, back to Ryzen. When I look at your Q2 outlook, it's going up about $170 million or so sequentially. And when I look at the last few years, generally Q1 to Q2, just the console side, has gone up over $100 million or so. So is it fair to assume that Ryzen perhaps is contributing something in that $50 million, $60 million, $70 million? And if that is the case, how does that compare to your original expectations? Did they change throughout the quarter because of whatever pricing action [people] might have taken? Just that this $50 million, $60 million, $70 million, if this is right, is this a run rate number for Ryzen? Or how should we put this in the context of what Ryzen can be as it becomes a bigger part of your portfolio?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. So without commenting on the exact numbers between semi-custom and Ryzen, I think it's fair to say that the semi-custom business will have a reasonable ramp in the second quarter as will Ryzen. In terms of relative to our expectations, it's actually very close to our expectations of what we expected the ramp rate to be as we're going into this new segment. As I think I mentioned on one of the previous questions, we don't expect to be at peak run rate in the second quarter. I think we will be continuing to ramp Zen-based product in the PC business throughout the year as we bring more and more SKUs online. And so I think the second quarter is -- will certainly be higher than the first quarter, and I would expect the second half to be higher than what we're seeing in the second quarter, as we ramp more and more SKUs, as more OEM platforms come online. As you guys know, the PC business is -- it tends to be a very back-half loaded business. So as we get into back to school, the retail segments and holiday, you would expect that both channel and OEM PC sales to benefit from the stronger product portfolio.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it. And as my follow-up, how do you feel about the PC gaming market for this year? I know just near term, there have been some concerns about excess-GPU inventory in China. Have you -- are those concerns based on fact? Or are they just perception? And have you seen anything abnormal in the demand or supply for PC-GPU product, in any region or any customer segment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, on the GPU side, we actually haven't seen anything abnormal. We normally see the seasonality going from the Q4 to Q1, that sales go down. We saw something very normal to that. From an inventory standpoint, we think it's normal to maybe even slightly lean because we were going through a transition from our 400 series to 500 series. So we see the gaming segment as healthy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And any comment for the full year? Last year -- last, actually, couple of years have been quite strong in PC gaming. I know you probably may not quantify it, but just how do you feel about the overall PC gaming market? Do you think the trend persists in terms of both unit and pricing expansion this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. From what we see, I think we feel good about the gaming segment overall. Graphics continues to be a strong segment. For, us it's not just a channel business, but it's the ramp of our OEM business. So we have a number of new OEM systems that are also ramping here in the first half of the year. As it relates to ASPs, we are excited with the launch of Vega that will see a significant improvement in our ASPs, just given our current presence in the high-end segment of the GPU market. So yes, overall, I think we feel good about the market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blayne Peter Curtis, Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actually 2 related ones. Just wanted to go back to the OpEx in terms of, not only is it up sequentially but then you're getting extra from the move of the mask sets. Can you just talk about where that OpEx dollars are going? And if it's, in fact, servers, can you just talk about the spend required to get at the market? And then just I wanted to clarify on the expense, it should hit gross margin, but can you just talk about 7-nanometer as a whole and timing as those would come through? Is it a back -- is the CapEx back-end loaded when you're doing the $140 million? And then just talk about the impact to the gross margin with the higher 7-nanometer spend now hitting gross margin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Maybe let me start on the OpEx and then have Devinder comment on the second piece of the question. So on the OpEx, we are making targeted investments in several different areas. The key areas are in GPUs and server. And it's both on the R&D side as well as on some go to market. So from our standpoint, these are very strong products. We want to make sure that we have enough customer resources to help our customers ramp into production. So I think they're targeted investments, but as we've been in the past, we'll be very prudent with where the OpEx goes. And then relative to the...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think the CapEx, you asked about the front end -- back end. I think it's pretty balanced. Maybe it's about $40 million, $60 million, first half, second half to $140 million, but it's pretty balanced.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blayne Peter Curtis, Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then just in terms of the impact to the gross margin as the mask sets roll through?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They're all contemplated. I think we've had a lot of discussion on the gross margin improvement year-over-year and sequentially. And Lisa has referenced about improving gross margins as we go through the year and the move of the other expenses from the OpEx side related to the mask costs capitalization to the COGS side of it, which impacts gross margin, is all contemplated in that gross margin improvement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next question is coming from Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wonder if you could talk about what the CPU mix looks like over the course of the year. And you've talked a lot about the Ryzen ramp, but what's happening to the older products? Do you see a long tail on that? Or is there a coexistence between the 2 product portfolios? Or are you sort of rotating everything to Ryzen on a faster basis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. So, Joe, the way to think about that is for the Ryzen 7 and a good portion of the Ryzen 5, we really didn't have a competing product in that segment, so it's really additive. I mean, we've actually added [SAM] to our CPU market coverage. The legacy products will continue in the market. They would certainly continue through this year, and that's all contemplated in the model. So we feel that they're very complementary products. And different geographies move at different rates. We have still a significant installed base of motherboards out there from our previous generation, so we'll keep supporting both products.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as you've talked about getting better Ryzen penetration over the course of the year, how do you think about Intel's new products in the back half? And you know, they've talked about sort of a 15% performance per clock improvement on their new 14-nanometer product. Is that contemplated in your guidance? And how are you thinking about the Ryzen products stacking up against that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. So we're very pleased with where the Ryzen product is positioned now. We think, from a value proposition standpoint, performance, performance per dollar, it's very strong. We obviously have -- other products are -- we're going to be launching throughout the year to ensure that we have strong product positioning throughout the year. And I think the more important thing, Joe, and we'll talk more about this at our Financial Analyst Day, is we have a long-term road map, whether you're talking about PCs or GPUs or servers, to ensure that we continue to refresh our product plans and our product road maps over time. So I think we feel good about where we are positioned today and we're going to ensure that we continue to roll out products to strengthen that positioning over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our final question today is coming from Chris Rolland from Susquehanna.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland, Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wanted to ask about the staggered launch to the major PC OEMs. Was that like just a modest supply constraint on the rollout? Or if not, then why not just launch to the enthusiast and the major PC OEM market together? And do you plan to do the same on Ryzen 5 and 3?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Chris. So there was no particular supply constraint. I think it's more of the ebb and flow of the market. When you think about the channel market or the DIY market, you can basically introduce your product any time during the year. The OEMs have a very set cycle. They typically launch new products in Q2 for the back-to-school season, and so that was just the timing of when the OEM platforms were ready. And then again, when you're launching so many different SKUs, I think launching Ryzen 7 first, then Ryzen 5, then Ryzen 3 was absolutely our plan to make sure that we hit all of the logistics and stuff on plan. But overall, like I said, nothing different than what we expected. I think we're pleased with where -- the overall launches, and we'll be rolling out many more products over the coming quarters.

Thanks, Arnab.
Revenue reached a record in the fourth quarter, totaling $1.4 billion, up 12% from a year earlier, up 7% sequentially, and above our outlook of $1.3 billion. Our full-year revenue crossed above $5 billion to a record $5.01 billion, which was up 7% from the previous year. Quarterly growth was broad-based, with expansion across each of our four market platforms -- gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive.
Pacing gains were our GTX gaming platform, our datacenter platform, powered by deep learning, growing adoption and automotive. Viewed from a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GP revenue grew 10% to $1.18 billion from a year earlier. Tegra Processor revenue was up 40% to $157 million. NVIDIA's strategy remains sharply focused on creating platforms for our key markets. Our progress stems from our success in creating strong products that are targeted at growth markets. In Q4, our four market platforms contributed more than 85% of revenue, up from 78% a year earlier. Our growth platforms collectively increased 23% year over year.
First let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue grossed 25% year on year to $810 million, with good momentum carrying forward from the previous quarter. Maxwell-based GeForce GTX processors continue to lead our gaming growth, combined with growing anticipation for VR and the launch of holiday blockbuster games. The GeForce GTX 970 GPU stands as the world's most popular graphics card on the Steam gaming platform. And we continue to get strong traction with our GeForce GTX GPUs that power gaming notebooks. That includes the recently launched GTX 980 for notebooks, which has enabled a new category -- enthusiast-class VR-capable gaming notebooks.
Excitement is growing around VR gaming, a key theme of last month's Consumer Electronics Show. We unveiled there our GeForce GTX VR Ready program to help gamers choose the best hardware for an immersive VR experience. And Oculus, which has now opened pre-orders for the Rift headsets, has exclusively certified GeForce GTX systems as being ready for VR.
GeForce sales are driven by the launch of great gaming titles, and that again proved true this past holiday season. Fallout 4 was among the standouts, recording more than $750 million in sales in its first 24 hours. Other major hits were Star Wars Battlefront, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and Rainbow Six. We remain pleased with the continued success of GeForce Experience, our gaming platform that automatically optimizes your PC settings for each game and downloads the greatest game-ready drivers. At the end of January, just 2.5 years after its introduction, GeForce Experience subscribers stood at $76 million, up 37% on the year.
Moving to professional visualization. Quadro revenue increased 7%, both sequentially and year over year, to $203 million. The refresh cycle of workstations continued to improve during the quarter, driven in part by new workstation configurations in the market. While VR is often portrayed as a consumer play, we are also excited by its potential in enterprise, particularly in areas such as medicine, architecture, education, and product design.
Audi now has 20 virtual showrooms, with several hundred expected later this year, that lets customers experience new models, customize them in real-time, and take them for a virtual spin. In a very different application, a startup called Surgical Theater uses flight simulator technology and multiple GPUs to allow surgeons to use VR to fly through a patient's anatomy and rehearse complicated procedures before making the first cut.
In datacenter, inclusive of Tesla and GRID, revenue rose 18% sequentially to a record $97 million, up 10% year on year. This reflects the extraordinary rise of deep learning, a field in which we are now engaged with nearly 3,500 companies and organizations, as well as growth in the number of high-performance computing applications that are GPU-accelerated. During the quarter, we launched key products for this market. And a number of the partners provided updates to their own work in this area that underscores the central role of the accelerated GPU platform.
A key development came during November's Supercomputing 2015 Conference, with the release of the latest list of the worlds top 500 fastest supercomputers. It showed that more than 100 of these systems are now using accelerators. Two-thirds of these use NVIDIA accelerators, up 50% on the year. For hyper-scaled datacenters, we announced a platform that lets web services companies accelerate machine learning. It consists of both the NVIDIA Tesla M40, the most powerful accelerator designed for training deep [nolla] networks, and the NVIDIA Tesla M4, a low-power small form-factor accelerator for machine learning inference.
Web services companies have enthusiastically embraced this trend. Shortly after our hyper-scale announcement, Facebook disclosed that it will use the Tesla M40s to power its next-generation computing system for machine learning applications. And earlier this month, AliCloud, Alibaba's cloud computing business, announced it will work with us to promote China's first GPU-accelerated, cloud-based, high-performance computing platform.
They joined other web services giants embracing GPUs for machine learning. During the quarter, Google outsourced its TantraFlow deep learning framework, which can be accelerated on GPUs. Microsoft Computational Network Toolkit was integrated with Azure's GPU Lab, enabling neural nets for speech recognition that are up to 10 times faster than their predecessors. And IBM revealed that its Watson systems are now using GPUs.
Progress continues to be made in our GRID virtualization platform, which enables companies to deliver graphs-rich applications to employees on any device, anywhere. More than 100 companies are participating in an accelerated deployment program.
Turning to automotive. Automotive revenue was a record $93 million, up 18% sequentially, and up 68% year over year. One of the biggest stories at CES was the introduction of our NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 self-driving car platform, which utilizes artificial intelligence to address the profoundly complex challenge of autonomous driving. As many of you saw, DRIVE PX 2 is a supercomputing platform the size of a lunchbox that processes 24 trillion deep learning operations a second, and delivers 8 teraflops of processing power, equivalent to that of 150 [metso pros].
It is a flexible platform that automotive developers can scale from one to four processors. And it can utilize passive cooling or integrate seamlessly with the water-cooling systems of self-driving EVs. Capable of fusing data from cameras, lidar, radar and ultrasonic sensors, it creates a full 360-degree understanding of what is happening around the vehicle. It localizes the vehicle on an HD map, and it determines a safe path forward for using deep learning techniques.
Volvo, well-known for its safety and reliability, will be the first to develop DRIVE PX 2, using it as the brain force fleet of 100 self-driving cars to be publicly available next year in its hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden. Just a couple weeks ago, the first autonomous shuttle, the WEpod, incorporating our deep learning platform, took its inaugural trip on public roads in the Netherlands, where it can be summoned with a smart phone app.
The DRIVE PX 2 launch generated enormous interest around the world from car makers, Tier 1 suppliers, and others. We are now collaborating with more than 70 companies that are developing self-driving car technologies. Finally, our OEM and IP business was $198 million, up 3% sequentially, driven by the seasonal demand for notebooks.
Now turning to the rest of the income statement. GAAP quarterly gross margin was 56.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 57.2%, slightly above our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins increased from a year ago. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $539 million, inclusive of $34 million of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses, including litigation charges, were $445 million, in line with our outlook.
For full FY16, our non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.72 billion, including litigation costs. Our focus on rigorous execution and enhancing efficiencies enabled our core operating expenses to remain flat from FY15, as we focused on expanding operating margins. GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $252 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $356 million, up 26% from $283 million a year earlier.
GAAP net income was $207 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.35, including $0.04 of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP net income was $297 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.52, an increase of 21% year over year.
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. At the end of Q4, our cash and marketable securities balance was just over $5 billion. During the quarter, we paid $62 million in cash dividends, and we closed our accelerated repurchasing agreement with an additional 4.3 million shares returned. As a result, we have turned to shareholders an aggregate of $800 million in FY16, meeting our intention we communicated at the start of the fiscal year. Over the past four years, we've returned more than $3 billion to shareholders representing 98% of our free cash flow. As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, our intention is to return $1 billion in FY17 through quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.
For FY16, revenue reached a record $5 billion, up 7%. Our growth platforms increased 26% year on year. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 56.8%, up 100 basis points on the year. Non-GAAP operating income grew 18% to $1.13 billion, with operating margin expansion up more than 200 basis points to 22.5%. Non-GAAP EPS grew 18%.
Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of FY17. We remain excited about our business prospects. Gaming remains strong and eSports, VR, and new exciting games will lift it further. GP-accelerated datacenters are expanding in both HPC and cloud, driven by the growth of deep learning. And autonomous driving continues to move forward. We have excellent positions in each of these growth markets.
We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2017 to be $1.26 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.2% and 57.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected be approximately $500 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of FY17 are both expected to be 19%, plus or minus 1%. Further financial details, including the CFO Commentary and revenue by market platforms are available on our IR website.
We will now open the call for questions. We ask you that you limit your questions to just two. Ash, would you please poll for questions at this time?

Questions and Answers

Operator [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya, BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the very good growth and execution. My first question, Jen-Hsun, is on the gaming segment. For the last two years, it has grown at over 30% a year. I don't know many other multi-billion-dollar businesses and semis that are growing at this pace. The question really is, how sustainable is this growth?
I understand the drivers. But could you help us ballpark that going forward over the next two or three years? Do you think of this as a 10%, 15%, 5% growth opportunity? Any guidance there would be extremely helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thanks a lot, Vivek. First of all, I think you captured the essence of it in your question. GeForce is really not a chip business anymore; it is really a gaming platform business. When you think about it from a gaming platform business, it has to be thought of in the context of the low gaming ecosystem and the gaming industry. It is $100 billion large. When you think about it that way and you drive the business that way and you create value that way, I think the prospects for our growth there is still quite significant.
There are several different ways we can grow the market. First of all, when we introduce new game platforms -- and this last couple of years, we've introduced Maxwell, it's the most successful gaming platform we have ever introduced. The installed base of about 100 million GeForce gamers in the world has an opportunity to upgrade to a new platform.
Another reason why we can grow is because the production value continues to increase, the graphics richness continues to increase. And we do that by inspiring the industry, providing a technology that helps it include our technology in a much easier way. And the way that we do that is called GameWorks.
All the physical simulations, all of the visual simulations, all the lighting simulations and all of the things that makes games beautiful today are easy to include by just supporting GameWorks. It has been an enormous success for us.
And of course, developing companies are still doing incredibly well. There are many countries around the world that are just starting to get into PC gaming. Southeast Asia is growing incredibly. And then not to mention that gaming is no longer just gaming. Gaming is all about sports now.
But we're starting to see a new culture and a new dynamic in gaming even beyond that. It's really becoming a platform by which people could share, and a platform by which they could artistically express themselves. If you look at some of these games today, it's something you enjoy well-beyond just playing the game. You use the game as an editor to tell stories.
And so these games like GTA 5, it's just fantastic for telling stories. And so you can see now that the gaming platform is going beyond games, it's going beyond sports, and now it is a creative platform. So there are just all these wonderful ways that the game industry has continued to be vibrant. And my sense is that we're going to continue to grow with it.

Vivek Arya, BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. And as a follow-up, Jen-Hsun, on your automotive business, as you move from entertainment systems that are graphics-intensive to more advanced computing systems, do you think it changes the competitive environment? And what I am referring to is, we have seen Qualcomm and others enter the segment, and they are making the case they can integrate a lot of different [piece] parts and tie back to their processor. And I'm trying to draw a parallel with what you had on the smartphone side, where you were specializing in one part, but others could integrate other parts and become more successful.
Is there going to be a similar situation in orders? Or do you think we should read it in a different way as to how your competitive situation can evolve in orders as computing becomes a bigger part of the application?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, we have to be mindful of competition. And there's a lot of ways to compete, there's a lot of different ways to bring value. And surely what you describe is one way to compete. Those aren't really the segments in a market that we'll address.
The way we think about infotainment is, there are segments of the infotainment market -- surely the parts of the market that we serve incredibly well -- with the richness of the displays, the number of the displays. And how the displays are going to be used in the coming years are going to continue to expand. You know that display costs are coming down, and outlet displays are becoming cheaper.
There are so many different ways to bring visualization into the car, to enhance the driving experience. You can also imagine how artificial intelligence technology can change the way infotainment systems are even used. One of our strategies of course, is to bring artificial intelligence technology to enhance how the driver communicates with the car. So there is all kinds of new technologies that we're going to deploy into the infotainment system, leveraging our expertise in deep learning.
The part of the market that you are starting to talk about is the segment of the market that we really introduced into the marketplace, which is the autonomous driving computer. We started talking about it several years ago -- I think it was like three years ago, at CES, when I introduced the DRIVE PX. Where we imagined that in the future, a car would also have a supercomputer inside that is powered by deep learning, that is powered by artificial intelligence. And that takes in the sensor input continuously from the car, what's surrounding the car. And infer from it the appropriate thing to do.
That vision three years ago seemed a little bit, if you will, outer space. But I think that it is very clear now that the technology that we are bringing to bear, deep learning, is really the best approach for helping car companies go beyond ADAS, which is going to be a commodity in the coming years, as you can imagine. Go beyond ADAS, and move towards assisted driving to full autonomous driving. So I think that we can add a lot of value there.
PX2 was really invented to allow OEMs to scale that entire range, from assisted driving all the way to fully assisted driving. And that is one of the reasons why we can support one chip all the way up to four chips, from passive cooling all the way up to integrating directly into the self-driving EV water-cooling system, that is quite available for most EV cars with liquid cooling. So I think that our strategy there is going to work out quite well. We add a lot of value. It is very algorithm-rich, it's very software-rich. And I think our DRIVE PX platforms is really quite state-of-the-art.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Lipacis, Jefferies LLC - Analyst [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for taking my questions. The first question, on the TDS business, how -- I'm sorry, the Tegra development services, you noted that, that was an important driver of growth. Can you give us a little bit more color on that business? How big is that? What end markets are you working with? What are you helping customers do? Can you hear me?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually, I'm just trying to figure out what your question was. Let me see. I guess I'd be reluctant to announce anything today, but there are semi-custom businesses that people need our help on. And we are open for business to help select partners develop proprietary systems that leverages the wealth of technologies that we have, whether it is in visual computing or deep learning or supercomputing.
So we can create systems and products and services that the world has never had before. That's an area that I think is of interest to us. It's an area that we will likely see a lot more success in the future. But there is not much to really announce today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Lipacis, Jefferies LLC - Analyst [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, fair enough. And second question on the gross margins. They've gone over the last three years from the low-50%s, pushing through 57% now. At what point do these [asset tow out]? How should we be thinking about that? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I appreciate that question. There are a lot of moving parts in our gross margins. Of course, our enterprise business is richer in gross margins. Our consumer business tends to be lower in gross margins. But at the highest level, the way I would think of our Company's gross margins, it's the nature of our business model is changing.
If you think about our business model, a long time ago, it used to be a chip business, but today we are a differentiated specialty platform business. What I mean by platform business is, it's of course the chips, the systems, but it's largely about the differentiated software that's on top of it.
So increasingly, you're going to find that our business is software-rich, it's services-rich. And if that is the case, one would think that our business model would become increasingly of that nature. And I think you're just seeing the reflection of that.
As our Company continues to move towards our differentiated platforms -- which was, call it, 50% just a few years ago, and is now reaching some 80% now -- as we move into these specialty differentiated platforms, the software content is just much, much higher. And our customers who work with us are not buying chips for their systems, for their commodity systems, but they are looking for a platform to solve a particular problem. And the problems that we would help solve, the solution that we bring to bear, is so high-valued, that I think that increasingly you should expect that -- well, you should hope, and I hope myself, that our gross margins continue to move along with the change in our business model.

Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hans Mosesmann, Raymond James & Associates - Analyst [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great, thanks, and congratulations, guys. Jen-Hsun, can you give us an update on the high-performance compute side of the business? How will Pascal compare to the upcoming other solutions in the market, specifically Intel's Knights Landing? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Hans, thank you. Our high-performance computing business uses an architecture we call accelerated computing. Accelerated computing is a model of computing that we invented almost 10 years ago. It's a very unique way of computing, and it takes advantage of the strength of the CPU, as well as the advantage of the world's most parallel processor, called the GPU. It is very software-intensive, it is very mathematics-intensive, it's very algorithm-intensive.
It's a problem that, when applied to some verticals, can accelerate computing dramatically. We see accelerations of 5x, 10x, 20x, quite normally, quite regularly. And the way that you translate this benefit to a customer is that it reduces their costs. Instead of building a supercomputer that may cost as much as $500 million, this supercomputer would be the world's best at $100 million.
That's a pretty substantial reduction in expenses. The power-build that they would spend on a regular basis would be dramatically reduced. So datacenters and supercomputing centers save an enormous amount of money.
On the other hand, the researchers see a substantial boost in their application throughput. So that is one of the reasons why accelerated computing is doing really well. We are seeing a couple of different drivers for accelerated computing and high-performance computing. Our datacenter business -- accelerated computing itself for supercomputing applications, whether it is weather simulation or molecular dynamic simulation -- continues to grow.
The killer app that we are starting to see -- and we have been cultivating for several years now, and it's now really turning the corner and going into turbo-charge and growth -- is deep learning. Almost in every field of science, as well as for web services companies, artificial intelligence helps them wade through, comb through just massive mounds and oceans of data to discover insight. So deep learning and using artificial intelligence technology across all fields of science -- I'm super-excited about the work that's going to be done in medicine. It's really going to see some great adoption.
I think we mentioned that in just a couple of years ago, we had 100 companies working with us in the area of deep learning, and now it has ballooned to 3,500. That is quite a large-scale growth. It is in industries all the way from life sciences to supercomputing of course, to web services of course, to even industrial. And the application for industrial would be Internet of Things. All of these sensors all around the world collecting data needs artificial intelligence software, deep learning software, to review insights.
In terms of our positioning relative to the competition, this is an area that we have a real advantage, and we have a real advantage for several reasons. The incremental cost to our Company, the incremental cost of engineering accelerated computing into our normal course of running our GPU business, GeForce business, is incremental. So the system, entire system, the 10,000 people in our Company, can quite easily, if you will, continue this rhythm. And quite a high-velocity rhythm, of bringing out new GPUs that are great for accelerated computing and great for gaming of course, and great for workstations.
And it's a natural course of doing work. This is not an adjunct business to us. This is our core business. At the core, that is our fundamental advantage, that it's a singular motion, singular execution, singular investment, singular architecture, incredibly leveraged, and the execution, as a result, is just absolutely flawless. So I think in the end that, that's our greatest advantage.

Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gabriel Ho, BMO Capital Markets - Analyst [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, this is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow up on your Tesla business. I think in a recent earnings call, Cray actually reiterated its expectation of over 50% of this $25 million revenue in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. And I think they cited DRIVE as one of three supercomputers that actually use Pascal. So how should we think about the benefit to your Tesla business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, Cray is a very important partner of ours. The thing that is really exciting for me, is to see them transition their business -- not transition, but transform their business, from one that is really focused on supercomputing centers to one that is also working on big data. This is an area where we can add a lot of value to them. We have a lot of expertise in this area.
And as they continue to evolve their market footprint beyond supercomputing centers and now into large enterprises, I think they can find a lot of success. They are seeing a lot of this success in this area. Big data analytics is square in their bull's eye, and I'm quite excited for them in the work that they are doing there. They are good customer for us, a great partner of ours and I'm excited to see their ongoing success.
The thing we are all seeing is that big-data analytics, the most powerful weapon for big-data analytics has recently been discovered. Deep learning is just a fantastic new computing model. It is able to discover insight that is provably now superhuman.
Its dimensionality in thinking through data is unrivaled in any approach that we have learned in the past. And that's one of the reasons why industries all over the world, from life sciences to industry to manufacturing to supercomputing, are jumping on the deep learning bandwagon. I think their adoption of Tesla, the NVIDIA GPU, is going to be quite a success for them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gabriel Ho, BMO Capital Markets - Analyst [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. As a follow-up, [your spend] seems to spend about $90 million in legal expense. How should we think about in FY17? And also, and can you give an update where you are in the case of [Qualcomm] and Samsung?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just as a backdrop, we litigated against Samsung last year. The expenses was what you are referring to. At the core of it, fundamentally, philosophically, we believe that it is inappropriate and it's wrong for Samsung to use NVIDIA's technology -- technology that has cost us billions of dollars to invent and use it without compensating us. At the core, I just think that is just wrong. And we think it's wrong, and that's the reason why we decided to litigate to sue Samsung.
The ITC has passed it's early decisions, and we disagree with them, we are disappointed by them. It's unfortunate that the business courts couldn't see through the obviously complex data associated with the technology. But we are disappointed by it. We have appealed for a review, and hopefully, in the near term, we will discover what the ITC will do.
But I still believe that it was the wrong thing to do, for Samsung to use technology that companies who are specialized in these fields invent, and to use it without compensation. And I'm disappointed with the decision from the ITC, but so be it.
Next year, we have plenty of things to go invest in, and we have plenty of growth drivers. You know that we have four powerful growth drivers in our Company. Gaming is one, VR is another, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. And we have plenty of growth drivers to go focus our Company on.

Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.J. Muse, Evercore ISI - Analyst [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, thank you for taking my first question. I guess first question, on the auto side. I'm trying to get my arms around how we should think about growth year in calendar 2016 off this 75% growth in 2015. If you could parse between your backlog for infotainment and your outlook there, as well as what kind of ramp you see with product development contracts on the ADAS side?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two questions there. First of all, our pipeline. We've talked about our pipeline several times. We've shipped probably 5 million, 6 million cars. We have another 20 million, 25 million cars to ship in our pipeline. So these are design wins that took quite a few years to have won, and quite a few years of engineering to ramp into production.
So we have a pretty good visibility of the pipeline and the opportunities that are ahead of us. Probably there is some market dynamics that's helpful to some of the design wins, the segments that we serve. Of course, at the time, a long time ago, it's hard to tell. But it's very clear now that the computerization of cars is a highly desirable end-user feature.
The partners that we worked with, the car companies we worked with, to computerize their cars, whether it is Audi or Tesla, whose cars are heavily computerized. Their growth prospects in the coming years are quite good. So I think that's one. We have a clear view of the pipeline, and I think the mega-trends of the computerization of cars is in our favor.
Now you mention -- secondarily, we introduced this platform called DRIVE PX. It is our economist-driving car computer platform. And the recent success of ADAS has really inspired just about every car company in the world to look beyond ADAS and what's beyond ADAS is self-driving cars.
It could be partially assisted, it could be mostly assisted, and it could be completely assisted. And in each one of those levels of autonomy, a different amount of computation would have to be deployed. We've created a scalable architecture that allows car companies to develop cars that are partially assisted, all the way to completely assisted.
We are working with quite a large number of customers now. Car companies, startup companies, companies that are largely cloud-based and have an enormous amount of data that they could transform into an automotive service, transportation-as-a-service. And so we are working with a whole lot of different types of companies, and I think this is going to be an area of quite a significant industrial revolution. And arguably quite a gigantic society good in the long term. So anyways, we are working on a lot of projects there.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chin with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chin, UBS - Analyst [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun, the first one for you, if I could. In terms of the deep learning, machine learning opportunity, I was wondering if you could help quantify sort of the longer-term silicon TAM for the opportunity, both in datacenter and automotive? And I guess more near term, any thoughts on what kind of development revenues could be generated for these machine learning-type platforms in the near term?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, thanks. I think part of the answer is, I'm not sure. Part of the answer is, I'm not sure. So with that as a disclaimer, let me tell you why I'm so enthusiastic about it. There are many problems that computer science has been trying to solve which, algorithmically, is just impossible to solve. There is no known way of a human-described algorithm that completely captures the noisy and long tail of society.
And it could be almost any problem. It can be weather-related-type problems. It could be market-related-type problems. It could be all kinds of purchasing-related challenges, and all kinds of data. It could be life sciences, as we know that the human body is not in a perfect condition all the time, that randomness that plays a role in understanding molecular science. There are so many different types of areas where there is no simple Newtonian physics equation that can describe the nature.
So in that particular case, using an enormous amount of data to train the neural net, to train software, to rewrite the software, if you will, using an enormous amount of computation, is a pretty exciting computation model. I think this is a brand-new computing model, one that is going to augment the traditional model of symbolics and computer programming. This is going to be a data-driven type of computing model. In this particular case, GPU accelerated computing is really quite ideal and the computing model that we invented some ten years ago is really quite ideal.
How big is it? I think that it could be quite significant. And we are starting to see, of course, the type of companies that are jumping on top of the deep learning bandwagon. They are great companies, from Google to Facebook to Vidu to IBM to Alibaba, to just about every hyperscale web services company in the world, is jumping on this. Because they have enormous amounts of data and it has very, very long tails. And traditional segmentation is too contrived of an approach to find great insight.
Now that the companies with a great deal of web-based data, cloud-based data, have already starting to engage in this area, they are starting to implement artificial intelligence into one application after another. I think we already heard them announce that it's very likely they will put artificial intelligence into every single application they have. We are starting to see this sweep across industries.
The automotive industry, of course, has the longest tail, as the world is a very noisy place. And in order to create a car that can navigate through it, the long tail of a very complicated world has to be handled somehow. Writing software programs is just not going to do it. So using an ongoing learning artificial intelligence network could be exactly the solution for it. Life sciences, industries, manufacturing, supercomputing, financial services -- the list goes on and on. And we are seeing a lot of enthusiasm.
Before everybody can use deep learning, they have to train a network. And this is an area where we have a great deal of expertise. This year, as you know, we also announced our first hyperscale inferencing engine. It's our first end-to-end training-to-inferencing -- inferencing is predictions, the application of the network. So from training all the way to inferencing, we now have a complete architecture that is architecturally compatible.
The Tesla M40 is for training, and the Tesla M4 is for inferencing. The M4 is a little, tiny credit card-sized GPU, and very low-power, incredibly energy-efficient. And you can connect it into just about any hyperscale datacenter in the world. And we are sampling customers now.
The results are quite exciting. Customers are very enthusiastic about it. I think we could dramatically reduce the cost of datacenters all over the world, as they start to ramp up artificial intelligence in their everyday workload.

Steven Chin, UBS - Analyst [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, I appreciate that color, Jen-Hsun. And as a quick follow-up, I have one for Colette on the inventory levels.
Colette, just given where inventories ended for the quarter, it's -- on a days and a dollars basis, it's roughly comparable to a number of quarters back, when revenues were about 20% to 30% lower than where it is today. Is this a new level that the Company can continue operating at, just based on supply chain efficiencies? Or is there some -- a seasonal volatility in December or any other kind of average ASP of the [prox] that you are carrying? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette Kress, NVIDIA Corporation - EVP & CFO [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Steven, thanks so much for the question. Our inventory levels that we are holding here, they are definitely going to swing a bit in terms of the mix, in terms of our platforms. But what we have right now, we do have a very healthy level of inventory. And we have a great team of people managing all of those different pieces, both for the channel, for our partners, and definitely for what we need to ship going forward.
So I don't think we look at a number to exactly optimize in any single one quarter, as we do make sure that we are prepared for the platforms coming down the pipeline, as well as what customers need. But you are correct, it is probably at a fairly healthy low level at this time.

Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia with Nomura Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Chaurasia, Nomura Securities - Analyst [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, Jen-Hsun. One question on deep learning. I was wondering if you could talk about relative opportunity sizes in training and inference part of the deep learning? Clearly you have a strong position on the training side. I would love to hear your thoughts of the inference side. My understanding is, a lot of custom chips are being built in the industry on the inferencing side. So I would love to get your color on what competition you're foreseeing on that front?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Here is my guess. I think long term, training will be half of the overall market. And the reason for that is because training is so heavyweight. And in the long term -- well, not long term now -- you're training your network constantly.
You create a network. You want to improve this network as fast as you can, because you have so much valuable data and so much insight that you can go after. And you deploy the network for inferencing, which collects brand-new data. And the world looks completely different to you.
You now collect that data, and you use that data to train your network. I think that network training is going to be continuous basis, and we're seeing that, absolutely. Also there are more types of networks.
The type of networks that are being created, the rate of revolution, the rate of innovation of networks -- network styles, network types, network configurations, network depths. It is happening every single week. I'm actually not exactly sure how you would design a custom chip for it. Which explains why there are only two chips today that are successful in inferencing. One of them is the Intel Xeon, and the other is the Tesla M40 and M4.
So I think the ability to adapt to new algorithms quickly, it's really quite vital as we go through the next several years of this artificial intelligence revolution. There is just so much algorithms being developed, and I think you guys are reading about it constantly -- new breakthroughs in AI, new breakthroughs in network design. At the moment, I just really don't know how someone would settle down and design a custom chip for it.
I happen to believe that long term, artificial intelligence is not a chip. Artificial intelligence is a computing model. And a computing model needs processors. And processors are programmable. And these programmable processors need to have rich software development environments around it, and these platforms need to be available all over the world.
Today the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform is available in a PC, in a work station, in a laptop, in the cloud, in a car, in robots, in embedded environments, and it's all exactly the same architecture. I think that, that's really one of our advantages, that we have the ability to be adaptable, programmable, and yet we are available in literally every single computing platform form-factor you can imagine. And the accessibility of NVIDIA's architecture is literally global, worldwide and within reach for anybody.

Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank - Analyst [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for letting me ask a question. One for either Jen-Hsun or Colette. In your first-quarter guidance, it looks like the down-10% has some seasonality to it. But you also have a lot of businesses that have secular trends behind them. So I was hoping that you could provide a little color on seasonality versus secular?
Or which of the drivers would be better or worse than that 10%? Acknowledging also that you lose a week of business guiding into that April quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, first of all, I appreciate your question. I think, first of all, it's just the guidance, and it's our best view today, it's our most prudent view today. And as you know, although there are many things we know, the world is a very uncertain place.
There's a few things that we do know. The gaming market is quite vibrant. It continues to be quite vibrant. We monitor it literally every day, every week. And we monitor it all over the world, and it remains quite vibrant.
In the coming months, there are some really wonderful games that are coming out, that we think are going to be spectacularly successful, whether it is The Division or Tomb Raider or -- the list goes on. So I think the gaming market appears to be quite vibrant.
Our automotive business is vibrant, and the work that we do in self-driving is really gaining traction and capturing the imagination of just about every car company around the world. Our deep learning work and supercomputing work, our high-performance computing work is accelerating.
In a lot of ways, I understand where you're coming from. But we don't want to ignore seasonality. Q1 is Q1, and we recognize that the market is uncertain. We will see how it plays out. At the end of the quarter, we'll come and report it again.

Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harlan Sur, JPMorgan - Analyst [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, good afternoon, and congratulations on another solid quarter. Jen-Hsun, you talked about the installed base and the upgrade opportunity in gaming, I think, last call. You quantified it as around three-quarters of the installed base that really needs a more updated GTX processor.
Given the 37% growth in the gaming business last year and the success of Maxwell, it actually does appear that you did drive some meaningful upgrade in the installed base. So the question for you is, is there any updates to your views on where the installed base sits at from that upgrade opportunity? And then the second question is, do you get a sense that the cadence of these upgrades will be accelerating, given the advancements you and your gaming engine partners are bringing to the market every year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those are really good questions. We monitor our installed base pretty carefully. Currently in the installed base, we basically have three architectures still in operation. We have the Maxwell architecture, and we have the Kepler architecture, and the Tesla architecture.
All of those -- oh, excuse me, the Fermi architecture. Those architectures are all running in the installed base at the moment. We have managed upgrade about one-third of the installed base.
Meanwhile, it is the case that ASPs of our chief use are going up, because the graphics richness and the graphics production value is going up. The quality of games -- because the market for games is so high, game developers can really create much more beautiful games, and take the risk to do that.
The developing markets are growing. The number of genres, like eSports, of games are growing. So there's a lot of different growing vectors.
Meanwhile, all of that is on top of our desire to upgrade our installed base, so they can enjoy games the way that it ought to be enjoyed. I think there is still a fair amount of growth opportunity ahead of us, and we will monitor it carefully and report it once a quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Deepon Nag with Macquarie Capital.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deepon Nag, Macquarie Capital - Analyst [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thanks a lot, guys. So Quadro grew for the first time, I think, in several quarters. Can you describe what drove that growth, and how we should think about the growth profile for the rest of this year? Is it possible that it could grow in the mid-single-digits for all of 2017?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Deepon, thanks for the question. I was delighted myself. I will just put that out there. We worked really hard to improve our Quadro business. The team works incredibly hard. We invented a new technology for rendering called Iray. It's the world's first physically modeled photo-realistic renderer that is accelerated by GPU. The results of it is really quite remarkable, and they continue to add new capabilities to it.
We, this last quarter, also benefited from the enthusiasm and excitement around VR. And we have VR SVKs and collaborations with just about every ISB in the world that is working on VR. So I think there's a lot of good reasons to be enthusiastic about Quadro.
We don't believe for a moment that the design quality and design production value of movies or games or architecture or manufacturing will continue. We believe absolutely that it's going to continue to improve. And visual realism and the productivity of the engineers that are involved, the artists that are involved, needs to continue to increase.
So we think this is going to be a vibrant growth area ahead. I think that what drove recently the uptick on the OEMs refreshing workstation cycle. And I think we should enjoy some of that for the coming quarters.
But I still think long term, the real opportunity, surely the market is there. We know that more and more of design and creativity is done digitally. So at the core, the market is there. The opportunity for us is to bring new forms of rendering, new forms of design. And as you can see, Iray is for rendering, and VR is for interacting with the design. These type of capabilities require just an enormous amount of GPU capability. And I think at the core, that is going to be our long-term growth drivers.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley - Analyst [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great, thank you. Can you give us some color on what you are seeing in emerging markets, with a lot of macro concern about some of your end markets, notably China? And you guys keep putting out very good numbers. Can you just sort of talk about that demand by geography, and how you weigh the economic and currency risks over the course of this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. For some reason, I still tend to believe that what drives the gaming market is great games. And I think that there is some evidence that the continued release of great games and great production value games, the vibrancy of eSports, the fact that eSports is really not just for competition, but drives the dynamic of sharing and social. Those kind of factors continue to drive our gaming business.
I'm quite enthusiastic about the developing markets. Southeast Asia, for one, is really starting to adopt PC gaming quite rapidly. It is a market that is extremely underserved. India is a market that is extremely underserved. They are underserved because broadband Internet hasn't been available to those marketplaces until just recently. And there are surely demographics in these markets that would love to jump onto gaming.
Who doesn't need a PC? So almost every market develops around PCs quite rapidly. I think the way of enjoying games is so affordable by adding a GeForce GTX to a PC that you already own, it's the most affordable form of entertainment, if you think about it that way. Most of eSports are free to play anyhow. So much of it is, anyhow. So it is a wonderfully affordable way to enjoy entertainment. So I think the Southeast Asia, India, are really quite exciting developing markets.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Ramsay, Canaccord Genuity - Analyst [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much. Jen-Hsun, there's been a lot of speculation about how the emergence of VR headsets, in particular for gaming, would drive your GPU business. I guess I would like to hear your perspective on a couple of things. One, obviously it requires high-end and high GPU use to support some of these applications. So of the early adopters, maybe a sense of which of those folks might already own those type of GPUs, and which ones might have to upgrade in the near term?
And second, how VR might penetrate the [East Forts] phenomenon over time and drive more of those upgrades into the higher-volume mainstream parts of the gaming market? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. There are really two questions in your question; they are both good. One question is, how do I feel about VR and its impact on gaming? The second part is, how will VR impact our business?
Let me tell you the second part first. We are not forecasting and not assuming any upside in VR. However, there's no way but good that VR will bring to our business. And we will take it a day at a time.
We believe that it's going to be an exciting growth driver. We believe that is going to be helpful to our high-end GPU business. But when the time comes, it will be a nice bonus.
So we're going to run our business as if we don't count on it. However, obviously we care very deeply about it, because we think that the experience of VR is quite amazing. Anybody who has tried it is surprised how immersive it is, how it takes you away from where you are and into another world. You are really suspended in disbelief, and it's as close to a holodeck as we have ever experienced.
So we believe strongly that VR is going to be fantastic for entertainment, it's going to be fantastic for games. We also believe that it's going to be fantastic for all of our pro-business. I wouldn't be surprised if the segment of our business that it helps the earliest may very well be our professional business.
The reason for that is because there are many applications that are mission-critical. Even though the headsets are not free, it's quite affordable. And for people who have power walls and use large displays, VR is actually an incredible cost reduction.
Almost anybody can now have a virtual reality cave, which cost tens of thousands of dollars. Anyone can now have a power wall, which costs tens of thousands of dollars. And now for just a few hundred dollars, have all the benefits of that.
So I think that you could tell that I'm very enthusiastic about it. We are developing a lot of fresh technology and new enabling technology to make it possible. We are working with all the market leaders to develop the market and cultivate the market. And then from a financial perspective, we will just see how it plays out. My sense is that it's going to be a really nice bonus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks very much for taking my question, and congrats on the good quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks a lot, Chris.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Hemmelgarn, Barclays Capital - Analyst [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all, we've talked a lot about some of the really exciting businesses that have a lot of great growth prospects for you. I thought we would look at, as well, some that have been a little more stagnant. And I was curious to your take on, for example, the OEM business.
It looks like it may finally be stabilizing after declining. How do you look at that business in the coming fiscal year? Do you think it can even get back to growth, or do you expect continued declines?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, my sense is that it will stabilize, and let me tell you why. Our OEM business is not about gaming, because it is our gaming business. And the OEMs are not about design, because that's our design business.
But the thing that some OEMs do is, they include our technology to differentiate a mainstream platform from a premium platform. So by adding NVIDIA's technology, you turn a commodity PC into a premium PC. And the experience is better, the performance is better, and everything just works.
So there is a real benefit in using it as a premium multimedia PC, if you will. So we'll probably see continued interest in doing that. And we are delighted by that. We don't count on it, but we're delighted by it. So my sense is that it will likely stabilize.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rolland with FBR & Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Rolland, FBR & Company - Analyst [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, guys, thanks for the question, and great quarter. Speaking about your installed base briefly, can you guys share with us your view on GPU replacement rates? How fast are they or how long are they now, and whether they are shrinking or speeding up here? And also perhaps how they might differ by geography?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't know if I have the precise granularity by geography, except for just a few countries. But let me address it overall. The installed base takes a couple two or three years to upgrade. And on the lower end, three to four years. On the higher end, one to two years. And so overall I guess, because the lower-end products are higher in volume, it would probably weigh the overall average to call it three-plus years.
But the ASP, of course, if you look at it from an ASP perspective, it's a little bit different -- it would probably drift up. The rate of upgrade appears to be increasing. I might also explain that the ASP of our overall portfolio increasing. I think the reason why it's increasing is because the size of the gaming market has now grown to a level that developers can take a fair amount of risk to add a rich content, rich production value in graphics, which they didn't used to be able to do.
They now have the benefit of a large installed base, a PlayStation an Xbox, a Nintendo and PCs, that they could actually create content that is really, really quite beautiful and technologically rich. Which drives up the adoption of higher-end GPUs, because you need higher-end GPUs to process it. I think that is quite a significant factor.
I think the other factor is that the game consoles, although nowhere near the performance level of our high-end GPUs, on average, is higher in terms of capability than our average installed base. That is actually terrific news for us, because a PC gamer who wants to enjoy games that are adapted from game consoles, which all of them are, now would have to upgrade their GPUs to enjoy at least a game console experience.
So I think that bottom half of our installed base has a real opportunity to enjoy at least a game console experience for just $150. For a $150 graphics card, you can get experience that is superior to a game console. That is quite an amazing value. That, I think, is also another reason to spur adoption.

Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajvindra Gill, Needham & Company - Analyst [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, and congrats as well. Just a follow-up question on the virtual reality market and how you are looking at that.
Can you talk a little bit about some of the PC requirements that are going to be necessary to use in Facebook, Oculus Rift headset when it comes out this quarter? And the cost that is going to be needed for the individual user? And contrast that from the business model that Sony is employing, which is basically, based on my knowledge, a bundling strategy with their PlayStation 4, which wouldn't require an upgrade to the graphics card or buying a new desktop? Just wondering how you think about those two different business models?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two different questions in there. One question is, what is the minimum requirement for VR today? Using today's graphics card as an example, the GTX 970, which is the most popular graphics card in the world, is the min spec for the Oculus Rift. And the reason why, of course, is because Oculus and their PC focus wants to have the best possible experience for the early adopters of VR, and I think that is a really prudent strategy. You want to delight all of your early adopters with the best possible experience.
But the way to think about it long term is that, as the market continues to grow and more content comes and VR moves into the mainstream, there is no question in my mind that our $100 and $150 GeForce GTX cards will, in the future, be able to play VR just perfectly. So this is not a question about the availability of technology or the cost of technology. As we know, technology continues to advance, and whatever experience today will continue to get more affordable long term.
Whatever the Sony PlayStation does, I think is just fantastic either way. What we would like to do is get people excited about VR.
And in the final analysis, there are TV gamers and then there are -- there are console gamers and there are PC gamers. They are different genres, and they are different applications and different styles, and very largely different customers. So I think we are just enthusiastic about VR, period. And over time, the technology will more and more affordable.

Our final question comes from the line of Brian Alger with Roth Capital Partners.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Alger, Roth Capital Partners - Analyst [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for squeezing me here at the end. I'll be very brief. The opportunity in automotive obviously continues to grow. And your unveiling at CES was impressive by anyone's standards. However, there seems to be two approaches to the automotive market as we move forward. There is obviously the closed system approach that Mobile [Life] seems to be pursuing, and what appears to be more of an open-architecture approach that you seem to have.
Can you maybe describe how things shape up for you as you look out over the horizon with sensor fusion and the various OEMs, and getting things right from a safety standard space, et cetera? Do we need the control of a closed system, or can we get it done with collaboration with others?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA Corporation - President & CEO [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. I appreciate the question. It's really a good question. This is really a matter of philosophy. And philosophically, this is how we see the world. We believe the self-driving car is not a solved problem. I say that as a statement of fact. I don't think anybody would dispute it.
I also believe that self-driving cars is a field that's going to require the technological muscle of a very, very large industry, and that no one company with a few hundred employees is going to solve it all by themselves. The idea that a unsolved problem of such incredible daunting levels, that an entire computer industry is in the process of trying to solve, could possibly be a closed system tied around a chip, seems illogical to me. That's number one.
Number two, I believe that long term, our car company, the soul of the car company is the driving experience of that car. The soul of the company is the safety record of that car. The soul of the company is the functionality of that car. In the future, the functionality, the safety, the driving experience of the car is going to be largely software-defined. It's going to be artificial intelligence network-defined.
I just can't imagine great companies like BMW and Mercedes and Audi and all of the world -- Toyota, and the list goes on -- and many great companies that are emerging into this marketplace. I just can't imagine that these companies would somehow outsource the soul of their car to a chip company. That is a second philosophical belief.
So what we have decided to do is to create an automotive autonomous car computing platform and all of the rich software that is necessary to enable this incredibly high-throughput computer to behave in a really energy-efficient way and cost-effective way. And to be able to apply our deep learning expertise, so that these cars can benefit from artificial intelligence to solve these really complicated world problems. And that by partnering with every single car company in the world, that together we might be able to solve this incredibly daunting challenge, and hopefully bring some society good.
So that is our approach as the open platform. And it starts really from a philosophical approach. Now, that philosophical approach results in a very substantial technological difference.
Notice that our platform is completely programmable. We have rich tools. We know that developers all over the world can easily buy themselves a GeForce TITAN and write CUDA applications. And those CUDA applications will tomorrow run on a DRIVE PX just seamlessly.
So I think that is a wonderful way for designers all over the world to be able to develop software -- which is really hard to do right now -- and then quickly deploy it into the car. So our strategy is just very, very different, and that is our approach. And my sense is, at the moment, it appears to be quite a good approach.
Okay, I really appreciate that question. NVIDIA is the world leader in visual and accelerated computing, which is helping to create exciting growth markets like VR, AI, and self-driving cars. Which will transform many industries and positively impact the future of society. Our strategy is to leverage one core investment into four growth markets -- gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and auto. And it's delivering results and gaining momentum. Our goal is to balance investments to capture the enormous opportunity ahead, while maintaining a keen focus on improving near-term financial performance.
I also want to remind everyone that our annual GPU Technology Conference will take place April 4th through the 7th in San Jose. We will be focusing on VR, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. We will also be holding Analyst Day there, and I look forward to seeing all of you. Thank you.

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.
On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. On our website, Microsoft.com/Investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Microsoft completed the acquisition of LinkedIn this quarter, and is reporting its results in the Productivity and Business Processes segment beginning on December 8, 2016. Accordingly, our key investor metrics do not include the impact of LinkedIn.
Additionally, for Q2 only we're providing non-GAAP results, excluding LinkedIn, to help investors compare our results to the guidance previously provided for the quarter. Our press release and slide deck contain supplemental information regarding the impact of LinkedIn on our financial results.

Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today I'll share the results for the second quarter and discuss what's ahead.
We had a solid quarter overall, delivering $26.1 billion in revenue, up 4% in constant currency. More importantly, we're making progress by innovating in new areas, growing our addressable market opportunity, and transforming our culture.
Wherever I go in my travels, whether it's in conversations with heads of state, NGOs or CEOs, the common thread is the transformative power of digital technology to unlock new opportunity. Everyone I meet is talking about building their own digital capability to transform their product, service and business model. They're looking to Microsoft for security, productivity, business process, cloud and AI platforms to help drive their own transformation.
In this last quarter we have continued to build momentum across all of these areas, and in particular AI. Just this month we acquired an AI deep learning startup, Maluuba, whose work in natural language processing will help advance our strategy to democratize AI for everyone. With that as the backdrop, I will turn to progress we've made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Process.
Office 365 commercial seats grew 37% year over year, and revenue is up 49% in constant currency. We're changing the nature of work with Office as the universal toolkit to help people and teams accomplish more together.
To that end, this quarter we introduced Microsoft Teams, our new chat-based workspace for Office 365. It brings together the full breadth and depth of Office 365, as well as connection to third-party services, all in a secure hub for teamwork. We are seeing strong demand for the preview from our existing Office 365 customers, due to the deep integration of the rest of the Office platform. And at the same time, customers not yet on Office 365 are excited about this new work -- way to work to see Teams as a potential first cloud workload.
In addition to collaboration, our innovation in security and compliance continues to drive customer preference for Office 365. This quarter we added new capabilities to give IT better ways to help the user safely connect to the third-party applications. And for compliance, new E-discovery capabilities make it easier and faster for organizations to find and analyze information related to legal and regulatory requests.
Customers also find value in the integration of SharePoint with PowerApps and Microsoft Flow to quickly and easily build mobile apps and automate workflows. In fact, just eight weeks after availability, we have seen more than 0.5 million people use PowerApps for Flow.
This combination of productivity, security, and agility is incredibly valuable to customers, particularly in sectors like financial services and healthcare. Take Willis Towers Watson, a global financial services firm who chose our premium enterprise offering, including Office 365 E5; global fortune 500 companies; TD Bank and ACSA; as well as Partners HealthCare and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, all chose Office 365 for its powerful security and productivity platform. And AstraZeneca recently upgraded Office 365 E5 for its advanced voice capabilities.
We are also expanding our growth opportunity beyond information workers by creating productivity solutions for retail, restaurant, hospitality and manufacturing employees, who have traditionally been underserved by technology providers. Microsoft StaffHub, a new application in Office 365, provides shift scheduling, messaging and sharing capabilities for all these front-line workers.
Now let me talk about the second part of our ambition in the segment, reinventing business process. We completed the acquisition of LinkedIn in December, marking the start of our journey to bring together the world's professional cloud with the world's leading professional network.
Our top priority is to ensure we innovate and drive value for LinkedIn members and grow their daily engagement., The LinkedIn Business Solutions' higher market sell and learn represent an expanded market opportunity for Microsoft, and we plan to diligently execute on this opportunity, keeping the member first ethos and focus.
We are seeing good results with the core experience, with our revamped mobile app driving significant engagement growth in 2016. This quarter, the sessions on LinkedIn grew more than 20% year over year, a consistent level of growth throughout 2016. We also achieved record levels of mobile page views and feed interaction, creating a healthy foundation for LinkedIn's marketing solutions, which includes the rapidly growing Sponsored Updates.
We also saw members engage with LinkedIn's hiring products at record levels as part of Talent Solutions. And LinkedIn's Sales Solutions have also seen rapid growth, Sales Navigator seats up more than 20% year over year during the quarter. Sales Navigator's success on multiple CRM platforms makes it an essential tool for every B2B salesperson, and one of our first integration scenarios will be to redefine social selling by enhancing Dynamics 365 with LinkedIn capabilities.
The combination of LinkedIn's Business Solutions and Dynamics 365 gives us a more comprehensive portfolio of business SaaS solutions and strengthens our position in this growing and competitive market. Dynamics 365 paid seats more than doubled again this quarter, and new enterprise customers are increasingly choosing our Cloud Solutions, with more than 80% using Dynamics 365.
DefenseReady is using Dynamics to give military leaders a 360-degree view of their organizations to quickly make informed decisions about capacity, planning and operations. Amway is using Dynamics 365 to modernize and empower their entrepreneurial sales force around the globe.
Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud Segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $14 billion, and we're on track to achieve our $20 billion in FY18.
Customers choose the Microsoft Cloud of the following reasons. They want a trusted, global, hyperscale cloud provider that meets enterprise-grade needs. They want hybrid support that is architected into the hyperscale service, as well is the cloud servers. They want higher-level services to help build their own digital capability across IoT, enterprise, app-to-app, advanced analytics and AI capability.
Moreover, and most importantly, CIOs, CSOs, BDMs and developers are all seeing the benefit from operational consistency, productivity and security across their entire digital estate, spanning Windows 10, Cloud and Security Management, Office 365, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility and Azure. A prime example is Mars, a $35 billion business with 60 brands.
An early adopter of Office 365, Mars is using Office and Windows 10 to transform how its 80,000-strong global workforce collaborates while staying secure. And more recently, they have begun running mission-critical workloads on Azure, with hundreds more on the way, including inventory management using Azure IoT.
Swift Transportation, one of the largest trucking companies in the United States, is digitizing work for nearly 20,000 drivers with Office 365 and Skype, and is using Azure to harness the data from their sensors-equipped trucks to optimize driver productivity and safety. Across industries we continue to see strong customer demand for our differentiated Cloud Solutions.
Azure revenue grew 95% in constant currency this quarter. Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 10th consecutive quarter, and more than three out of four Azure customers are using Premium Services.
We are also leading the next-generation programming model and developer services innovation, with conversational bots, microservices, and event-driven serverless compute to help businesses rapidly gain the benefits of cloud infrastructure. Our bot framework is being used by more than 77,000 developers to do everything from e-commerce to customer service. Azure Functions is helping companies like AccuWeather and [Plexture] to quickly and easily implement business-critical, event-driven serverless processes, and everyone from game developers to financial services companies are using Azure Service Fabric for their low-latency, high-scale microservices applications.
We're also rapidly expanding our portfolio of data and AI capabilities in Azure. Cognitive Services, now deeply integrated with Azure Data Lake, enables customers to use industry-leading AI capabilities to easily analyze images, text, emotions, speech, sentiments at terabyte scale. In our push to meet the needs of any developer on any platform, we joined the Lennox Foundation, welcomed Google to .NET foundation, and announced new Azure partnership with OpenAI to accelerate our vision.
At the edge of our cloud, Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2016 give enterprises Azure-inspired scale and innovation for secure infrastructure and cloud applications. Customers have already deployed more than 1 million instances of Windows Server 2016, and the new SQL Server drove a 5 times increase in developer downloads in Q2 versus Q1.
Now I'll turn to our progress in more personal computing. This quarter we saw growth across Windows broadly. First, Windows 10 commercial customers are rapidly adopting Windows 10, driven by the need for a secure and trusted platform. In fact, this quarter enterprise and education deployments increased 52%.
Accenture, Broward County School District, UnitedHealthcare Group, are just a few that are choosing Windows 10 as their modern, secure, enterprise-grade platform. These three commercial customers alone have already deployed more than 300,000 seats, with commitments to deploy over 0.5 million.
The consumer PC market is also stabilizing. Gamers are increasingly turning to Windows 10 Premium PCs for the best gaming experiences, logging more than 26 billion hours of game play on PCs and tablets this year.
One reason gamers love their Windows 10 PC is because they can connect to their favorite games and social network on Xbox Live. Xbox Live monthly active users grew to 55 million this quarter, a new record, with growth across PCs, mobile, as well as the console.
Windows 10 Creators update will bring 3-D mixed reality and game broadcasting to all Windows 10 customers. Partners like Dell, HP, Lenovo and Acer are investing to deliver cutting-edge virtual reality experiences for customers using Windows 10 holographic platform. We're also broadening our opportunity to partnerships with chips at makers Intel, as well as Qualcomm, who have committed to build the next generation of modern Windows PCs with advanced security, connectivity, AI and mixed reality in gaming.
Our services, innovation and user engagement on Windows 10 continues to grow. Users have asked Cortana more than 18 billion questions to date, and we're opening up new addressable markets with Cortana Devices SDK. BMW, Renault, Nissan, HAMANN are all using Cortana to embed voice-activated intelligence into their portfolio of products.
Finally, let's talk about devices. I'm excited about the customer reception to Surface Studio, our latest innovation in Surface line, and a new device category. Overall commercial demand for Surface remained strong, with three consecutive quarters of more than 25% growth. Organizations across industries are looking to Surface to help them achieve more, such as Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom, rolling out Surface to more than 25,000 of its employees.
We are expanding into new markets with HoloLens. Commercial customers, like ThyssenKrupp Elevator, are using HoloLens to enable servicing up to four times faster than ever before, and we look forward to making HoloLens available in China in the first half of this year.
As customers embrace these new computers and computing experiences, we're generating enthusiasm for Windows 10, and new forms of expression, creativity in gaming that it can unleash. I'm proud of the progress we made this quarter and during the entire first half of the year.
We look to the second half with a clear focus on execution and innovation. We have a significant opportunity this year and beyond for growth across every one of our segments. We are uniquely positioned to build a technology that helps every person and organization take advantage of new innovations, like AI, and use them to drive their own growth and transformation.
Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you for questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy Hood, Microsoft Corporation - CFO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Satya and good afternoon, everyone. I want to reiterate that my commentary reflects our performance, inclusive of approximately three weeks of LinkedIn results. For this quarter only, I will comment on our results, excluding LinkedIn, for consistency with the guidance provided last quarter. I encourage you to reference our earnings slides for supplemental information.
Our second-quarter revenue was $26.1 billion, up 2% and 4% in constant currency. Gross margin grew 3%, up 5% in constant currency. Operating income grew 5%, or 8% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.83, an increase of 9%, and 13% in constant currency.
Excluding LinkedIn, our second-quarter revenue was $25.8 billion, up 1%, and 3% in constant currency. Gross margin increased 3%, and 4% in constant currency. Operating income grew 8%, and 11% in constant currency. And our EPS was $0.84, increasing 11%, and 15% in constant currency.
Our investment agility and execution focus resulted in strong performance this quarter. From a geographic perspective, our results were largely in line with macroeconomic trends, with additional benefit from a healthier PC market, particularly in the commercial segment.
Our commercial cloud services drove our annuity mix up slightly year over year to 84%, even with better-than-expected transactional revenue performance. Commercial bookings increased 7%, or 12% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue met our guidance range at $21.1 billion, growing 8%, and 9% in constant currency, even with an FX headwind of approximately $150 million, due to the strengthening US dollar through the quarter.
And our contracted not billed balance reached an all-time high, exceeding $28 billion. Our commercial cloud revenue run rate grew to more than $14 billion, up 49%. Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 48%, up 2 points from last year, largely driven by improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage.
And gross margin dollars grew again, increasing 62% across the commercial cloud. We remain on track for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year.
Now to Company gross margin. Gross margin was approximately 62%, inclusive of LinkedIn, up slightly from the prior year. This quarter, the strengthening of the US dollar relative to major currencies created additional negative FX impact on total and segment-level revenue.
On total revenue, FX had a 2-point negative impact, 1 point more than expected, with no additional impact from LinkedIn. In both Productivity and Business Processes and the Intelligent Cloud segments, the FX impact was 2 points, 1 point more than expected. And in More Personal Computing, FX had a 1-point impact, in line with expectations.
Total operating expenses grew 1%, and 2% in constant currency. Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses declined 2%, also 2% in constant currency. Operating expenses were under our guidance range, primarily due to a favorable one-time legal settlement and FX benefits.
Now, let's turn to each segment. This quarter, revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes LinkedIn, grew 10%, and 12% in constant currency, to $7.4 billion.
In Office commercial, revenue increased by 5%, and 7% in constant currency, as Office 365 growth again outpaced the shift from the on-premise business. Office 365 commercial revenue increased by 47%, or 49% in constant currency, driven by a combination of install base growth across all workloads and ARPU expansion.
We also continued to see higher-than-expected results from our transactional business, in part due to an improving commercial PC market. Office Consumer revenue grew 22%, or 21% in constant currency, as we continued to see an increase in our subscriber base and growth of recurring subscription revenue. In addition, the higher growth rate this quarter aided by post-launch inventory drawdown in the prior period.
Our Dynamics business grew 7%, up 9% in constant currency, and our Dynamics 365 install base more than doubled. LinkedIn revenue for the three-week period from December 8 to the end of the quarter was $228 million.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 5%, and 6% in constant currency, while segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud sales mix, as well as roughly 1 point of impact from LinkedIn.
Operating expenses grew 13%, 14% in constant currency, driven by the LinkedIn acquisition. Operating income declined slightly, but was up 1% in constant currency, and up 7% in constant currency, excluding LinkedIn.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.9 billion in revenue, growing 8%, and 10% in constant currency. Server grew 12%, and 14% in constant currency, with strong momentum in our Azure business and another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth.
Post-launch demand and purchasing ahead of currency-driven pricing adjustments contributed to a higher-than-expected transactional revenue, mainly from Windows and SQL Server 2016. As expected, enterprise services revenue growth declined this quarter 4%, and 2% in constant currency, due to lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 service agreements.
Gross margin dollars grew 2%, and 4% in constant currency. And segment gross margin percentage declined, due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and a lower enterprise services gross margin, partially offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin.
We grew operating expenses by 12%, and 13% in constant currency, with continued investment in cloud engineering sales capacity and developer engagement. Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency.
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectation at $11.8 billion, primarily from stronger-than-expected performance from our Windows business. Overall revenue declined 5%, and 4% in constant currency.
Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter. OEM Pro grew 6%, better than we anticipated, driven by an improving commercial PC market and enterprise demand for Windows 10. OEM non-Pro grew 5%, ahead of the consumer PC market, as our partner ecosystem continued to see growth and share gains in the Windows Premium device category.
Inventory levels remain normal. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 5%, and 6% in constant currency, with double-digit annuity billings growth and install base expansion.
Patent licensing declined this quarter, driven by lower unit volume and revenue per unit. Our search business, ex-TAC, grew 10%, and 11% in constant currency, with improving profitability and continued growth in Bing from higher revenue per search and search volume.
In our Devices Business, revenue declined 35%, down 34% in constant currency. Phone revenue declined 81%. And we closed the sale of our feature phone business during this quarter.
Surface revenue was down 2%, and flat in constant currency, as we continue to phase out the Surface 3 device. Importantly, Surface gross margin dollars grew 6%, and 17% in constant currency, from increasing mix of Pro 4 and Book, replacing Surface 3 in the portfolio.
In gaming, revenue declined 3%, and 1% in constant currency, due to lower console hardware pricing and Xbox 360 volumes. In this holiday quarter, as Satya mentioned, we reached an all-time high of active Xbox Live users, which helped to drive our gaming software and services revenue to 18%, and 21% growth in constant currency. This marks our first billion-dollar quarter in digital transactions for our gaming business through our universal store across Windows 10 and Xbox One.
Segment gross margin percentage and dollars both increased this quarter. Gross margin dollars grew 3%, and 5% in constant currency. And gross margin percentage expanded, with the continued shift to higher-margin products and services.
Operating expenses declined by 12%, also 12% in constant currency, from lower phone expense, a one-time legal settlement and reduced marketing spend. Growth from Windows 10, the shift towards higher gross margin products and services, and devices and gaming, and disciplined operating expense management resulted in operating income growth of 33%, and 37% in constant currency.
Now back to our overall Company results. We invested $2.5 billion in capital expenditures, inclusive of capital leases, as we continue to support customer and partner demand across our commercial and consumer services. During the quarter, other income and expense was $186 million.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. We returned $6.5 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, completing our prior $40 billion share repurchase program this quarter as we committed.
Now let's turn to the outlook. First, FX. We had originally expected FX rates to lessen going into H2; however, given current rates, we expect continued currency headwinds for the rest of the year. For Q3, we now expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue.
Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point in More Personal Computing. In Q4, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact on total revenue, 3 points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point in More Personal Computing.
Second, our commercial business. We expect our commercial cloud services to continue to drive annuity growth, as we expand our install base, grow consumption and execute well on renewals.
We expect commercial unearned revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion, in line with historic seasonality. We continue to expect some volatility in our transactional business, due to macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing shift to the cloud.
Third, CapEx. We will continue to meet customer demand by expanding data center capacity, while driving efficiencies through new technologies. With the addition of LinkedIn, we expect our capital expenditures, including capital leases, to grow sequentially to support a broader portfolio. For the full year, including LinkedIn, we continue to expect the CapEx growth rate to be lower than last year. Let's turn to our outlook for the individual segments.
In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion. This reflects a continued annuity shift to the cloud, with Office 365, Dynamics' double-digit billings growth, and LinkedIn revenue of approximately $950 million, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting.
In Intelligent Cloud we expect $6.45 billion to $6.65 billion of revenue, with continued annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services.
Enterprise Services. Revenue should decline again, due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 service agreements.
And, in More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $9.05 billion to $9.35 billion. In our OEM business, we anticipate revenue growth will exceed the overall PC market. Continued growth in Pro, driven by enterprise momentum for Windows 10, should be roughly in line with the commercial PC market, with some additional benefit coming from the prior-year inventory build. Our OEM non-Pro performance should grow ahead of the market, due to strength in the Premium device category.
In search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q2. As a reminder, total search revenue growth will slow now that we've passed the one-year anniversary of our Yahoo deal and the associated change in revenue recognition.
And in gaming, we expect normal post-holiday trends, with declines in hardware console volumes and pricing, balanced by higher engagement, usage and transaction volume. In devices, we expect revenue to decline, driven primarily by phone. Surface revenue is expected to decline slightly, with our ongoing Surface portfolio mix shift to Pro 4 and Book.
We expect COGS of $8.35 billion to $8.45 billion, including approximately $400 million of LinkedIn expenses. LinkedIn COGS include approximately $220 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets. We expect operating expenses between $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion, with about $970 million from LinkedIn. The LinkedIn expense includes about $160 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets.
For the full year, we now expect operating expenses of $33.1 billion to $33.3 billion, with about $2.3 billion from LinkedIn. The LinkedIn expense includes roughly $360 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets.
Other income and expense should be $150 million. We continue to expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 20%, plus or minus 2 points, with variability driven by the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vest.
Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to announce that we will hold a financial analyst briefing for the investor community in conjunction with our Build Developer Conference in May here in Seattle. We will share more details as we get closer to the date. Chris, let's move to Q&A.

Questions and Answers
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Suh, Microsoft Corporation - General Manager IR [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to the Q&A portion of today's call. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.
(Operator Instructions)
Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley - Analyst [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent. Very nice quarter, guys. Thank you for taking the questions.
I wanted to ask a question about LinkedIn -- what our expectations should be for achieving revenues synergies on LinkedIn. It seems like there's a lot of real interesting things you can do with that asset, and combining with your own portfolio. And how should we think about the potential for achieving some expense synergies?
Obviously, there's a big cloud base that you could utilize under their assets, and Amy [being bullish] and very good at keeping expenses very well-managed. So, as we go forward past the [forward] quarter, how should we think about the timeframe for achieving those benefits?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Amy to talk about the specifics of the synergies. The core focus, Keith, for us to start with, is to ensure that the innovation roadmap we have is all driving member value. The core ethos of LinkedIn needs to be about member first, how do we increase the engagement on the mobile flagship application, as well as the revamped desktop experience that is now rolling out.
We think that that's at the core of being able to, in fact, then have all of the revenue growth in their business solutions, which across higher markets sell. So, that's how I see it. It's a two-sided market, which starts with the help of membership and member engagement.
That is where the product roadmap, whether it's the integration with Office 365 or Dynamics 365 -- we'll be staying focused on it. We expect to see that rollout pretty rapidly. And as far as the guidance we've given at close, in terms of what to expect, for example, around EPS impact -- those are things that we'll stay committed to. And I'll let Amy add more to it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy Hood, Microsoft Corporation - CFO [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I think Satya is correct. The guidance we gave at the time of the announcement in terms of EPS solution, excluding the impact of purchase accounting, being minimally dilutive, 1%, plus or minus, stands. Including the goal to achieve synergies where they make sense, as we continue to focus on growing the core business and keeping it incredibly healthy and realizing the revenue synergies that we know exist across the businesses.
As a reminder, the two biggest impacts of purchase accounting -- one, is it does impact the deferred revenue. So the in-quarter revenue in the guidance will look a bit lower due to that, as well as the amortization of intangible expenses, which also hit. We'll take care to give you insight into those so that you can continue to hold us against the goals we set for ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Suh, Microsoft Corporation - General Manager IR [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Keith. We'll move to the next question, please, operator.

Brent Thill, UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brent Thill, UBS - Analyst [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks. There are a number of investors that have been wondering about the sales reorg that takes place February 1. Perhaps this is being worried and overstated. Can you just give us a sense -- are there changes that are happening that will take place February 1 that are different, or is this a minor tweak to the go-to-market going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can comment on it. I'm not particularly sure exactly what is happening on February 1.
But, I would say the overall change that we're going through -- and this is been ongoing for, I would say, the last multiple years -- is transforming our field engagement model, where we are putting a lot more technical depth in the front line sellers so that they can engage. Whether it's data specialists, cloud specialists, security specialists, or even productivity specialists. Because it's super important for us in this phase, when people are looking for solutions to help them digitally transform, for us to have a very fundamentally different type of capability in terms of our sales.
And that's the transformation. We have really reorganized ourselves, both in the headquarters and the in the field to be able to recognize such shift. What used to be large accounts for us, for example, are not by PC count anymore. And that's a pretty fundamental change.
It's by consumption of cloud capacity, in many cases. And this is happening all over the world. So, that's the transformation that you will increasingly see us push forward.
And no status quo on any part of Microsoft's organization should be counted on. If anything, we'll push to make sure that we are addressing what is our growth opportunities pretty aggressively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy Hood, Microsoft Corporation - CFO [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And I think, Brent, in terms of there being a date -- or a particular date -- this is something, to Satya's point, we've been doing in a step function improvement over time for the past couple years. And we'll continue to do it.
The guidance certainly doesn't imply any type of slowdown in the commercial business. In fact, in some ways it actually includes an acceleration in certain areas. I think that's how I tend to look at it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brent Thill, UBS - Analyst [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Suh, Microsoft Corporation - General Manager IR [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks Brent. We'll take the next question, please.

Operator [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you. Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs - Analyst [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. Thank you very much. Amy, you noted a material improvement in Azure margins this quarter. I was just wondering if you could share with us -- given how quickly revenue is growing in this area, how fast can we see margins ramp, which obviously were negative.
And now that you're getting to some big revenue numbers, is there any reason why, at a similar revenue scale you shouldn't be able to match the gross margins of what AWS -- what you can back into from the financials of AWS? Can you walk us through the puts and takes? And then once you hit that scale point, is it something that we should see inflect pretty quickly? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy Hood, Microsoft Corporation - CFO [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Heather. Let me start by saying, we really do think about and talk about our cloud as containing all of the components. From the IS layer to the platform layer to the SaaS layer. You'll hear us talk about Dynamics 365, Office 36t, as well as our Azure Core and Premium services.
So, when I think about the material gross margin improvement we saw on Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on. Where we've been discussing, as you continue to see customers ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate consistently, securely, through one interface, you'll actually see growth across all components of that cloud.
It benefits margin, not just in Azure, but across, actually, the entirety of the cloud. That 2 point year-over-year increase in the commercial cloud gross margin really, even with the massive growth in Azure over the course of the year, certainly implies the improvement that we expected.
But, I tend to think you will consistently hear both Satya and I refer to our cloud in its entirety. But I do respect people always wonder, so I did comment that we saw material improvement in Azure, specifically

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs - Analyst [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great. Thank you.

Karl Keirstead, Deutsche Bank - Analyst [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you. Amy, I'm going to ask another question on gross margins, but this time at the Microsoft level. Your prior guidance was for ex-LinkedIn FY17 gross margins to be down 100 basis points. So the quarter you just posted gross margins ex-LinkedIn were actually up. And if I ran the math accurately, it looks like for your March quarter, ex-LinkedIn you're expecting gross margins to be about flat.
It feels like you are outperforming the core Microsoft gross margin guidance you gave before. Are you sticking with the down 100, or has that improved? And if it has, what are the one or two biggest drivers of the gross margins feeling a little bit better, ex-LinkedIn? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy Hood, Microsoft Corporation - CFO [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Karl. I am sticking with it being about 1 point. That is the guidance we gave and, even inclusive of LinkedIn, I continue to believe it is about 1 point. So, in some ways I guess you could say it implies a slightly better at the Company level, if that's how you're thinking about it.
Really Karl, what can drive that, in addition to the overall gross margin improvement we talk about in the cloud, it's also really the strength we see in our Windows business. And I mean that, not just in our OEM business, but also across the commercial business for Windows. That tends to have a very good margin profile.
And as we continue to improve the margin profile of our devices, we continue to see the OEM business health improve. And, actually, we continue to see the growth in the consumer services around the transactions that run through Xbox.
That's also good margin business for us that looks quite different than the hardware profile. So, all of those can impact it, Karl, as we look through the rest of the year. But in general, inclusive of LinkedIn, I'm still around 100 BPS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karl Keirstead, Deutsche Bank - Analyst [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it. Thanks, Amy.

Thank you. Mark Moerdler, Bernstein Research.

Mark Moerdler, Bernstein - Analyst [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you. Congrats on the strong quarter and thanks for taking the question. So, Amy, the on-premise server and tools business grew 5%, 7% in constant currency. It was obviously helped by Windows Server 2016, Sequel Server 2016.
How should we think about, on a longer-term horizon over the next 12 months or even longer -- how those two should help on the on-premise isis or annuity business on the cloud and Azure? How should we think about the impact of that? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy Hood, Microsoft Corporation - CFO [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks, Mark. Let me start by saying it's why we tend to focus all up at that server products and services KPI being double digits. Generally, an easier way for us to talk about it all up between Azure and the OnPrem business.
But let me talk a little bit about what impacted the transactional business this quarter. And then we can talk about how to think about it in Q3 and maybe going forward. We did, and we're encouraged by the customer reaction -- even our transactional customers -- to the security and management value prop, as well as the hybrid nature of our Sequel and Windows Server 2016 releases that have taken place this year.
That value prop is resonating. We saw some growth. I feel very good about that. And so I do think that can have an impact in H2.
You heard me talk a little bit about it. With the major currency changes we saw in Q2, we've also done some price adjustments between certain geos for us. It did pull forward a bit of revenue into Q2.
And so it will be a bit of a drag on Q3, which is taken into account in the guide. But, I would reiterate, the biggest driver of the transactional performance this quarter was really the value prop people saw.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Moerdler, Bernstein - Analyst [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Suh, Microsoft Corporation - General Manager IR [27]

Walter Pritchard, Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Walter Pritchard, Citigroup - Analyst [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi. Thanks, Amy. I'm wondering if you could talk about -- we're still seeing the majority, or really all the growth, in operating profits come from MPC in the year-over-year basis.
And I'm wondering how we should think about the factors impacting and the timing in the handoff of profit growth from MPC to IC and PBP? Is that something that you expect? What are the factors and timing there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy Hood, Microsoft Corporation - CFO [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right. I would say, actually, we've also seen some operating income growth in our PBP segment this quarter, up in constant currency to 7% before LinkedIn. I do want to say some of that impact is absolutely landing, as well as growth.
But, the heart of your question is really about the MPC transition in IC. The way I think about it, we really -- Satya and I and the leadership team decided, gosh, about 18 months ago -- it's been a little longer than that now -- to over-index on investing, because the TM we saw in the intelligent cloud.
We increased hiring, and we invested in direct customer acquisition costs, and we invested in many of the things Satya just talked about in terms of technical capabilities in our sales force. We're starting to see the benefit of that already in our top line numbers.
That 12% or 14% in the server product and services KPI is a very good number. And I continue to expect that we'll see growth in revenue as those resources both get hired, and get up to speed, and add value at accounts.
A lot of that account value, frankly, Walter, today is coming in the form of consumed revenue. Consumed revenue is actually a great leading indicator for what we expect our Azure growth going forward to be. And so some of the confidence that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense and to even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we're seeing today, as well as the pipeline of projects and customers that we have.
I do think about that being an 18-month investment we've been making. It's starting to pivot to consumed. It will then land as billings, and ultimately in RP&L as GAAP revenue in quarter off the balance sheet.
But I think you're right. We have been working, and continuing to reinvest and save through the year as we look to get everything here more efficient. People often think we focus on cut here or add here.
It's also about -- are we putting every dollar most efficiently to help customers be successful? And I think that's a lot about what you heard Satya talk about the sales transition we're going through. Whether it's how we build products, and so I actually am confident you will start to see that transition land.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And I think Amy described it well in answering the very specific technical question of segment reporting and the margins in it. But architecturally, some of the examples are used are about the digital estate that actually doesn't start with Azure. In many cases, it starts with advanced [set] protection of Windows 10 estate, and then how does that relate to Office 365? How does that relate to Azure Active Directory?
And then the workloads that they may want to put, which are T01 workloads in Azure. It's very similar to what happened even in the client/server era, but of course, the starting points and how this progresses is very different. So we always think at least of the technical architecture that makes us unique in differentiated spanning all of it. So I don't think of it as margin shifts across the segments, and that's why we think of all of this as one digital estate, at least from a customer end perspective.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Walter Pritchard, Citigroup - Analyst [32]

Chris Suh, Microsoft Corporation - General Manager IR [33]

Operator [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you. Mark Murphy, JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Murphy, JPMorgan - Analyst [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Thank you. Satya. I'm wondering what you think would be required to extend the hyper growth trajectory for Azure into the future. For example, are there incremental waves of activity on the horizon that you would tie to Tier 1 workloads, or large data center migrations, or serverless usage which would enable that?
And separate from that, Amy, I'm curious just philosophically, how do you plan to handle price cuts for compute and storage when they occur? Do you think you're better off matching them, exceeding them? Or does it make sense, perhaps, warranting a Premium in many cases due to the differentiated IP that you have up the stack?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me start. Overall, I think some of the trends that you've referenced, whether it is Tier 1 workloads, or serverless, or even complete data center migrations, all of that is happening.
And even the customer examples I gave, they were littered with example after example. For example, in [finsa], some very Tier 1 trading applications now using some of our capabilities in service fabric, which is really a past service, which allows you to manage microservices with low latency and high scale. That's a place where we're seeing, in fact, activity, whether it is game development or trading applications.
We're seeing even interesting use cases of Azure Functions, which is completely serverless. In fact, you can even think of it as a price cut for anybody who cares about using consum -- being very, very smart about cloud consumption going serverless is something that we, in fact, advocate. Across the board, I feel we have the right mix of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and full user SaaS services, like Azure Active Directory, which gives us the right mix to be able to even have the right margins long-term.
We're not concentrated in any one layer of the stack, which is something we do by design. Because our vision has always been that we want to, of course, offer all of these layers, and customers will choose, depending on their needs and their scenarios. And we're now seeing even a single customer estate spanning all of these.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy Hood, Microsoft Corporation - CFO [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And, Mark, I'm not sure I want to get into our pricing theory on the call on a go-forward basis in terms of whether or not we match competitors. But what I would say, is really fundamentally related to Satya's point around differentiation of the entire stack and what customers are doing in their digital estate. And the ability to earn margin through that is actually more impactful than whether or not you match pricing at the core.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Suh, Microsoft Corporation - General Manager IR [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Mark. We'll take the next question, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you. Kash Rangan, BofA Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kash Rangan, BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi. Congrats on finishing up a great quarter, as well. One for you, Amy, one for you, Satya.
One, Amy, when I look at your comments on gross margin, clearly you're not in a position to break out Azure-only gross margin. But I'm wondering if you could take -- come past your commercial cloud targets were about $20 billion.
So if I take what I believe could be a rough split between Azure versus the SaaS segment and look at the best (abrate) companies, I could get to about 70%, 75% gross margin when you hit your targets. Curious what you think about that. Is that too aggressive, or within the ballpark?
And for you, Satya, as cloud computing moves to the enterprise, there's some belief among investors that AWS is going to be a big, strong competitor in the enterprise, so just typically not the stronghold for them. How do we think of Microsoft's enduring strength in the enterprise? And how confident can we be that you should be able to capture your fair share of enterprise workloads as they move to the cloud? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me start with the second part, and then you can add. Kash, the way I think about it is, even in the client server era, we had tough competition. We had Oracle, we had VMware, and we had many other players we competed with and I grew up competing with.
And we now have AWS, who I think is going to be a credible competitor. So I feel that, as I said, we have a cloud strategy that is not just about infrastructure. It is about really SaaS and infrastructure.
We want to uniquely think about what are the things that we can do to differentiate and add value to our customers' digital estate in the cloud in that context. And that's where, if you will, our fair share will come from -- by competing hard where we have to, but also mostly thinking about differentiation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy Hood, Microsoft Corporation - CFO [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And in terms of, is there a long-term gross margin cloud number that is industry-leading, I think right now there's a benchmark in the SaaS community that's probably around the number you talked about in terms of more SaaS applications. And then as you go down through the layers from PaaS to IaaS, that margin declines, obviously, much as it did when that was run as a hardware solution.
The margins were not as high, either. I do think it will be a blend of those, but certainly at the SaaS end, I understand where you get that benchmark from.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kash Rangan, BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Suh, Microsoft Corporation - General Manager IR [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you Kash. We will take the next question, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you. Phillip Winslow, Wells Fargo Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phil Winslow, Credit Suisse - Analyst [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus back in on Office 365 on the commercial front. You have another strong quarter of revenue growth, obviously at 49% constant currency, but it continues to meaningfully outpace the seat growth, which is still strong, but 37%.
That commentary that you all are giving about premium mix in the past -- two questions here. First, to Satya, when you think about where we are in the progression -- call it up to E5, so to speak, or E3. How do you think this plays out? And how do you think about the mix of unit growth versus that premium mix and translating it to revenue?
And then to Amy, I'd argue that maybe we've done the low margin, or low gross margin parts of the Office 365 transition. And now as this mix goes up, you're actually not just increasing revenue, but the margin is better, too. Is that fair? And then, how do you tie that back to your commercial cloud gross margin expectations long term?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I can start. On the product side, we think of actually three things which we're trying to do on a continuous basis in Office 365. First, even for the customers already in Office 365 at any given licensing level, we focus quite a bit on their increased usage and intensity.
So, for example, one of the comments I made in my remarks was, for example SharePoint with PowerApps and Flow. That's, to us, the best way for us to keep having that recurring value. And so we focus quite a bit on adding additional value, even to the existing licensing levels and increasing intensity of usage.
Then, things like, what we're doing to even go to non-knowledge workers, audiences in retail or manufacturing, with some of the things that we're doing with staff scheduling, for example. That's a way to expand seats, even beyond what is the traditional knowledge worker. Of course, we have a significant more opportunity in small- and medium-sized businesses, although we have good, healthy growth there.
I think seat growth will come, more from material increases internationally, as well as with some of the regulated segments of the market finally moving to the cloud. Those are all opportunities ahead.
And then the last one, of course, is these new value in things like E5 with voice or analytics and security. So all those three dimensions, there will be variability quarter to quarter in terms of what is happening, but in terms of our investments in the core product value, they are actually happening on all those three.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy Hood, Microsoft Corporation - CFO [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And to your point on where we are and what's driving that delta and its consistency, frankly over time. Actually, still, the biggest impact is from the transition to E3. The transitions take time.
You're just starting to see some of the impact from E5. We're excited about all the customers in trial and already starting to use the value, whether it's security, increasingly analytics, and ultimately voice. But really, from an ARPU perspective, the biggest driver continues to be the transition to E3.
Then that leads to your question on, do you continue to believe there is some margin expansion possible as you add newer and higher value workloads? And of course, the answer to that is we do believe that. But it certainly comes over a period of time and runs through our annuity base over that pace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phil Winslow, Credit Suisse - Analyst [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Suh, Microsoft Corporation - General Manager IR [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Phil. We will take the next question, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ross MacMillan, RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross MacMillan, RBC Capital Markets - Analyst [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks so much, and congratulations from me, as well. Two questions. One for Amy first.
When we look at CapEx, it actually declines year over year ex capital leases, but even with capital leases, the growth rate decelerated. And for the full year, it's obviously a pretty wide range, roughly 0% to 40% growth. I'm just curious, Amy, with LinkedIn, have you made any changes to your CapEx assumptions for core Microsoft?
I guess I'm pointing to the fact that it did seem to decelerate quite a lot this quarter. I wondered if there is any additional color you could frame around growth rate for all-up Cap-Ex plus capital leases. Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy Hood, Microsoft Corporation - CFO [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure. Let me first comment on that I've said it will be lower than it was previously. I certainly would help you in that number and say a little lower. Just so that you're getting into something closer -- I realize 0% to 40% is not as helpful.
I would also say that it does tend to be lumpy, and it's why I don't give very specific guidance every single quarter. And it was not at all impacted by LinkedIn. Our real goal for LinkedIn is over time, of course, I'm sure they'll want to take advantage as we build new services together of some of our infrastructure assets.
But in the short term, the most important thing, is they continue to add value and usage and great experience for their members. I have really no intention of messing with that in terms of capital expenditures in the short -- next six months, for sure. I think what you're seeing in terms of year-over-year and what does it mean for next year, this next quarter, it will be a sequential increase. But again, it is a bit lumpy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross MacMillan, RBC Capital Markets - Analyst [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Suh, Microsoft Corporation - General Manager IR [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Ross. We will have time for one more question, please, operator.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you. Raimo Lenschow, Barclays Capital.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raimo Lenschow, Barclays Capital - Analyst [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for squeezing me in, and congratulations, as well. I wanted to ask on Windows 10 -- Satya, you talked about at the beginning of that [cast] is trying to adopt it. And you mentioned pretty large ones already.
Can you talk a little bit about that cycle and how you seeing that's unfolding? And what the customer feedback is in terms of their intention to adopt it now versus waiting for little bit? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corporation - CEO [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I think the overall adoption cycle of Windows 10 in the enterprise is perhaps the best that we've seen in the enterprise for any new release of Windows. And primarily driven by security and manageability of the new Windows and that's what has been the driver.
But in addition to that, I must say there are two other things that are increasingly becoming fairly relevant in the adoption cycle, which is moving to both Office 365 and Windows 10 and getting essentially to this new frontier for productivity, which is an always up-to-date operating system, which is secure, and an always up-to-date office experience that is a fast service. We are increasingly seeing that resonate, not just in small business and high tech industry, as it has been in the past, but now even in the regulated parts of the enterprise. So we are very excited about that.
The other piece also that's driving is hardware innovation by the entire ecosystem. In fact, the work that we did with the Surface line has really stimulated the entire ecosystem to do some of the best innovative work. And you saw that, even as [TES]. And the enterprise adoption of these new devices is also driving the overall excitement around Windows 10 and Windows 10 innovation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raimo Lenschow, Barclays Capital - Analyst [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Correct. Thank you.

Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Skip. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Q4 and full year 2019 annual results conference call.
Before begin -- we begin the Q&A session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the fourth quarter and the full year 2019 as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of our Q4 and full year 2019 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and on our future business outlook. Thank you. Roger?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2020.
Q4 results were basically in line with our guidance. Net sales came in at EUR 4 billion. Net system sales of EUR 3.1 billion was heavily weighted towards Logic at 83%, with the remaining 17% from Memory, clearly showing the continued strength of Logic business as well as the ongoing digestion phase of the Memory business. We reported EUV system sales of EUR 922 million from 8 shipments.
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 906 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 48.1%.
Overall, operating expenses came in above our guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR 516 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 148 million. Higher than guided SG&A is due to additional employee benefit costs and costs related to our IT implementation.
Turning to the balance sheet, EUR 186 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q4. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.7 billion. This amount is significantly higher than anticipated with most of the cash coming in, in the December period.
Moving to the order book, Q4 system bookings came in at EUR 2.4 billion, including EUR 1.1 billion for 9 EUV systems. Logic order intake was 79% of the total value, with the remaining 21% from Memory, again, reflecting the continued strong Logic demand for our leading-edge lithography.
Net income in Q4 was EUR 1.134 billion, representing 28.1% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 2.70. For the full year, net sales grew 8% to EUR 11.8 billion. The Installed Base Management sales was EUR 2.8 billion, which was a small increase compared to previous year.
In 2019, we booked EUR 6.2 billion of EUV orders, which is more than 50% of the total bookings value for the year, reflecting customers' strong demand for EUV technology. We continue to invest in the future of ASML and increased R&D spend to EUR 2 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the acceleration of our EUV road map, low and High-NA program. Overall R&D investments as a percentage of 2019 sales was about 17%, SG&A was about 4% of sales.
In addition, ASML invested EUR 886 million in CapEx supporting our long-term growth opportunities primarily around High-NA capacity and infrastructure.
Net income for the full year was EUR 2.6 billion, resulting in 21.9% of net sales and an EPS of EUR 6.16.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2020. We expect Q1 total net sales between EUR 3.1 billion and EUR 3.3 billion. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 950 million driven by strong demand for field upgrades, especially EUV.
Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 46% and 47%. The lower gross margin relative to the strong Q4 number is primarily due to Deep UV mix effect, fewer immersion and more drive systems with some positive EUV mix effect.
The expected R&D expenses for Q1 are around EUR 550 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 140 million. Our estimated 2020 annualized effective tax rate is around 13%.
Regarding our capital return, ASML paid total dividends of EUR 1.3 billion that made up of the 2018 dividend and 2019 interim dividend, and purchased EUR 410 million worth of shares in 2019.
Through December 31, 2019, ASML acquired 9 million shares of the 2018-2019 program for a total amount of EUR 1.6 billion. Supported by our long-term business plan, ASML will submit a proposal at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to declare a dividend for 2019 of EUR 2.40 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR 1.05 paid in November 2019, this leads to a final dividend of EUR 1.35 to be paid in the second quarter. This is a 14% increase compared to the 2018 dividend. The 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on April 22 in Veldhoven.
ASML announces a 3-year share buyback program of up to EUR 6 billion to be executed in 2020 through 2022. ASML intends to cancel these shares after repurchase with the exception of up to 0.4 million shares, which will be used to cover employee share plans.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.

Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had a very strong quarter, resulting in another solid year of growth driven by Logic and EUV. We were able to achieve an 8% top line growth despite an overall industry decline of around 10% due to a weak Memory market. There's always a reflection of our Logic customers drive to continue to innovate and invest in technology for future nodes. For 2020, we currently expect a year of double-digit growth in both sales and profitability primarily driven by EUV and installed base business.
Major innovation drivers such as artificial intelligence, 5G, high-performance compute, autonomous driving and big data are creating new end-user applications, and these applications require more high-performance Logic, fueling increased demand for leading-edge nodes. And this is evident in several customer announcements regarding ramp plans for the 7- and 5-nanometer nodes, which will drive another strong Logic year and an increased demand for EUV.
In the Memory market, the customers have indicated they're seeing signs of demand recovery in some market channels, and improvements in Memory chip pricing also support this view.
As customers have lowered litho tool utilization to reduce wafer output throughout the weak Memory demand period, they will first use this underutilization to return to normal supply levels, which will take some time. Subsequently, this will also trigger equipment demand, albeit a bit later than the supply/demand recovery for Memory devices. Taking the slope of the recovery of our litho equipment utilization as a proxy, it seems likely that we will see stronger litho equipment demand for Memory in the second half of the year.
We expect significant growth in our installed base business, service business will continue to scale as our installed base grows, and we'll also see EUV contribute to service revenue as these systems start running wafers and volume manufacturing now. We expect significant demand for upgrades, particularly in EUV, as customers utilize upgrades as a quick way to increase capacity. In EUV, it was a breakthrough year, with the technology now starting in high-volume production and producing consumer products that are already available in the market.
As we continue to execute on our accelerated EUV road map, we were able to ship our first NXE 3400C in 2019, which provides high productivity, translating to increased customer value, delivering higher ASPs and improved gross margins. We shipped 6 3400C systems in Q4 of the 8 EUV systems total we shipped in the quarter, bringing the total to 26 EUV systems and full year sales of around EUR 2.8 billion in 2019.
Increasing customer confidence in the EUV is translating into more layers in Logic production as well as expanding to new markets with the adoption in Memory. For full year 2020, we plan for EUV sales of around EUR 4.5 billion on 35 systems. We continue to see demand building for next year's shipments and expect a healthy order flow to continue.
In order to fulfill the expected strong demand increase, we're working on the cycle time reduction to enable a capacity of 45 to 50 systems next year. 2021 is shaping up to be a very busy year.
Regarding our current outlook for the year, we expect 2020 to be another growth year as mentioned before. Although it's too early to provide quantitative expectations, let me make a few qualitative comments.
Major innovation drivers and applications that require high-performance Logic are driving increased demand at the advanced nodes. Logic demand is currently strong, and we expect this demand to remain healthy primarily driven by EUV. And as previously communicated, we expect sales of EUR 4.5 billion on 35 systems this year, which translates to EUV sales growth of approximately 60%.
Memory is showing early signs of recovery. And although there's still uncertainty around exact timing of the recovery, it is likely we will see stronger demand in the second half of the year. And taking this into account, we expect a stronger second half with strengthening sales throughout the year.
Summary, 2019 was another great year, with continued positive momentum in EUV as well as short demand across our entire product portfolio. We expect another growth year supported by healthy Logic demand and likely recovery of the Memory market, with increased sales from our installed base business as well as demand for EUV. The positive industry momentum around innovation and expanding new markets further strengthens our confidence in 2021 outlook and our 2025 growth scenarios.
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.

Skip Miller, ASML Holding N.V. - VP of IR [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Peter and Roger. The operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Now, operator, could we have your final instructions and then the first question, please?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My question has to do with your comment regarding EUV manufacturing capacity of 50 system by 2021. Peter, do you think your backlog would reflect that capacity as we progress through the year? In other words, would you be able to have a full commitment from your customer for full capacity? And my short follow-up has to do with your -- the multibeam EUV wafer inspection. Are we still on target for the first shipment in the first half? And how should we think about the time it would take for your customers to evaluate the tool?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, Mehdi, thanks. On the EUV capacity, yes, I think the backlog will reflect this. I think the order intake on EUV is looking very healthy. So I have little doubt that we'll have the backlog fill this year to support the capacity that we have lined out now for 2021. I think the issue here is really we need to reduce the cycle time, which we have good plans for. I mean we see first progress. I think the focus is on cycle time reduction in this case. MB, multibeam inspection, yes, we will ship in the first half. And I think the customers will probably take throughout this year to evaluate the tool so that we can start shipping next year in higher volume.

The next question is from Mr. David Mulholland.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Terence Mulholland, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director and Equity Research Analyst - Technology Hardware [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is Dave Mulholland from UBS. Just to follow-up on some of the comments you made around Memory. Obviously, there are some indicators, things are improving. I think some of the checks we've been doing through the supply chain are certainly pointing to improved capacity plans particularly potentially from Q2. When do you think you could start seeing that in orders? And I guess in some respects, why haven't we already seen some of it in Q4? And then I'll come back with a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Thanks, David. It's a good question. I wish I had a definite answer because that would make things easier. So I'm basically saying, we have -- when we -- when I said in my prepared remarks that we see the utilization of our tools going up, and we just extrapolate the slope of utilization increase. And I think it would mean at the end of the first half of this year, we will see likely a return to a normal supply/demand balance for our customers. Now they see that also and taking into account the order delivery times, the order lead times, then I would expect orders have to come in somewhere in Q2 in order for us to make sure that in the second half of the year, we could see an increase of our Memory business.
Again, we're in this business for quite a long time, and in my experience, Memory always comes back with a vengeance. They -- when it comes, it always comes quick, so we'll just have to wait. So I think it makes a big difference whether orders come back in Q2 or they come back in Q1 or in early Q3, I mean it makes a big difference for the year. So we just have to wait and see, and I wish I had a final and definite answer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Terence Mulholland, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director and Equity Research Analyst - Technology Hardware [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay. And just one, second follow-up on the Installed Base Management business. Obviously, a very strong run rate in Q1 at EUR 950 million. How do you think about this on a full year basis? In the past, you've had a target, I think, of EUR 3.7 billion but been slightly more conservative run rate through the last couple of years. What's driving the pickup in Q1? How should we think about that on a full year basis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

David, I think the -- if you look at Q1 and also if you look at Q4, you see that the momentum was already building up in Q4, where we were already slightly over EUR 900 million, EUR 950 million for the quarter. We expect that we will not be able to sustain it at this level for the entire year. I think a good way to go would be to say that we're probably going to see a 20% increase over last year annualized. So that would get you to approximately EUR 3.4 billion for the year. That's where we would see it for the for the full year.

The next question comes from Mr. C. Muse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. I guess first, I was hoping to hit on gross margins. Can you walk through where we exited on EUV in the fourth quarter? And then how you are seeing the trajectory for overall gross margins through the year, increased EUV shipments as well as likely higher immersion shipments in the back half for DRAM?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Thank you, C.J. So let me first talk about gross margin for EUV and then give you the wider picture on gross margin. So on EUV, what we said, as you know, last year, on the systems side, systems gross margin for EUV, we're looking at about 30%, this year, we're looking at about 40%, 4-0. So that's what we have in the plan, and that's what we're executing for, and that's also in our models for this year.
On the wider picture for gross margin, and I know that many of you are looking at the Capital Markets Day. At the Capital Markets Day, we mentioned 50%. So let me start there, let me start at the 50% and let's look at what the circumstances were at the time, what the circumstances are today, and then we will start talking about how we see this to unfold and what the potential is that we see for this year.
So back in November -- at the Capital Markets Day in November 2018, I think there are 3 things that we should bear in mind. First off, at that stage -- what we modeled at that stage for you, and that had the 50% in there was what we called a mid-market growth scenario. And I think in all likelihood if we look at the circumstances today, if we look at the circumstances of the Memory market today, then I think it will be hard to say that for the full year, we're looking at a mid-market scenario. It's definitely not what we're looking at today, depending on when it's going to come back, and as Peter said, how it's going to come back. You could, on average, see a mid-market scenario. But at this stage, I think it's hard to say that we're looking at a mid-market scenario for that. At this stage, the Memory market in these months is fairly flat. So that's one important circumstance I think to recognize.
The second thing that I think changed from November 2018, and I think Peter already responded to that in the first question, is the multibeam. So the delay in the multibeam, we're -- I think we're going to see commercial application and commercial sales of multibeam only in 2021, we're at a Capital Markets Day, as you know and as we already told you also last year, we were still looking for 2020 as commercial application of multibeam. So that's, in essence, shifted with a little under 1 year. So that's the second circumstance to bear in mind.
The third thing that deviates a little bit from what we told you in the Capital Markets Day in November 2018 is a bit of accounting issue, and that has to do with High-NA. We are preparing for High-NA not just on the R&D side, but we're also preparing for High-NA on the manufacturing side and on the supply chain side. And we are incurring cost there that we cannot capitalize and have to run through cost of sales, which is a bit weird because we're not selling High-NA, but nonetheless, that's what the accounting will dictate you to do. And that represents a little short of 1% alone in gross margin. So those are 3 things to bear in mind that might be different from the perspective and the model that existed in November 2018.
So now let's look at this year, and let's look at the 46% to 47% that we have for Q1, and let's look at the potential for the rest of the year. And I think there's a number of drivers in there that I think could further drive the gross margin up. The first one obviously is related to the situation in the Memory market, and that is pretty important, not just for the top line but it's also very important for gross margin. Because if we see a solid recovery in the second half of the Memory market, that will have a significant impact on the sale of immersion tools, which, as all of you know, comes with pretty high gross margin and also with a good recovery in our voltage contrast business, which, as you know, is also very much tied to the Memory business. And again, that is a very high-margin product that we have. So if we get the recovery in the Memory market, that will also have a significant impact on the gross margin on those 2 elements alone.
The second element that will -- that is expected to further drive up the gross margin throughout the year is the EUV service. EUV service for the full year is still expected to be -- to have negative gross margin. But over the quarter-over-quarter, you will see a sustained improvement in the gross margin that we have on EUV service. For 2 reasons, first off, because, as you know, with a number of customers we have the pay-per-wafer model. And to the extent that EUV continues to go into high-volume manufacturing, obviously we get more revenue. And secondly, the cost that we have per EUV machine goes down because we get more efficient in doing it, and we also get scale effects as a result of that.
So quarter-over-quarter, you will see that the EUV service margin will improve. For the full year, it's still negative, but at least in Q4, maybe even a little before that, we will see that it starts to become positive.
Third improvement that we expect to occur in the course of this year will be the introduction of our new immersion tool, the 250 -- the NXT:2050, which, again, comes with a good improvement of our gross margin. So those are 3 significant drivers that we have, that we believe give us a good shot at achieving a significant improvement of our gross margin particularly in the half and a good shot at the 50%.
And then this 50%, we will be able to then sustain further into 2021, which, as Peter already alluded to, we think is going to be a very busy year. And a very busy year at that stage would also come with a number of scale benefits in our gross margin, better fixed cost coverage. And also in 2021, we would see the introduction of a successor to EUV that would also again, come with gross margin improvement. So then we think that momentum that would be created in the second half around reaching the 50% would then be further sustained and elaborated on into 2021 time frame.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very, very helpful. If I may follow up. I think the buyback announcement, as we're moving into high-volume manufacturing EUV, seems to be a bit of an inflection here for ASML begin the cash cow mode. So curious if there are metrics that we should be looking at whether it's free cash flow margins or working on working capital or perhaps CapEx intensity coming down as you've invested in EUV capacity, High-NA, multibeam. So curious if there's kind of a metric we should be looking at to gauge free cash flow in the coming years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. And then -- so in the short term, you will see that with the increase in EUV and EUV becoming increasingly important for the company, given the cycle time of EUV is significantly lower than Deep UV, in the short term, you may expect that inventory levels will continue to go up a little bit. That's a dynamic on the one hand. And also in the short term, as you -- as I think we've said before, you might expect that the CapEx level that you've seen for 2019, that will be above the CapEx level that you might expect for this year and for next year. So around EUR 900 million to EUR 1 billion is the CapEx number that we think is likely for this year and for next year. So those are dynamics in, I would say, in the short term.
In the years thereafter, I expect CapEx level to level off and actually go down because then the significant preparation for our future, I think, CapEx-wise, I think will have been done and will be able to go down. Also I would expect that in 1- to 2-year time frame, you might expect inventory levels to go down for a number of reasons. First off, at that stage, we talked about 2021, there is a significant buildup of our capacity for EUV. But once you are there and once you are at those levels, then the further buildup of inventory will no longer have an impact on your inventory levels.
And secondly, as we mentioned before, the way we believe we will be able to get an increase in our capacity from the 35-ish that we have for this year to the 45, 50 that we talked about for 2021 will primarily be the reduction of cycle time. And of course, the reduction of cycle time will then kick in and further reduce working capital requirement.
So in the short term, I think the burden on working capital will still be there. In the longer run, so let's say, 1.5, 2 years, you will see that we will be able to get it under control better.
One final dynamic as far as that is concerned, we talked to you in previous calls on the introduction of down payments for EUV, which we're pushing and where we had the initial accomplishments on that in 2019, and we'll continue to drive that. And that will also be a mitigating factor, if you like, in our working capital burden. So long-winding answer, just to tell you that in spite of all of that and in spite of this preparation for the growth, we're still looking at a pretty healthy free cash flow development, both this year and next year. And then the years thereafter, I think the free cash flow that we generate will further increase substantially. And all of that taken together gives us more than enough comfort to introduce this EUR 6 billion program for the next 3 years.

Next question, Krish Sankar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish Sankar, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's Krish Sankar from Cowen. I had two questions. First one, on EUV. So Peter, it looks like your commentary on 2020 EUV of 35 systems at EUR 4.5 billion revenue and next year about 45 to 50 systems capacity is similar to about 3 months ago. I was in the impression that over the last 3 months, at the margin, there was more incremental demand from DRAM for EUV. So I'm just wondering, is it an issue that you're still capacity-constrained and that's why you cannot ship more? Or are you being conservative? And then my second question is, how to think about DUV units this year relative to 2019, would it be similar levels, lower, higher? Any color would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. On your first question, I actually -- I tried to answer that in an earlier question that the issue with 2021 is to make sure that we can reduce the cycle time so much that we can create a capacity between 45 and 50 units, which is a capacity issue, not a demand issue. So yes, DRAM will be there. I would just have to make sure that we can squeeze as many EUV systems out of our available square meters so that we can fulfill the customer demand. It's not a demand issue, it's a capacity issue.
So in joined essence, that's why the commentary is similar to what we did last quarter because the capacity lead time, fortunately, is a lot longer than just the customer order lead time.
Now on the DPV units, good question. Very much changes on, and Roger said it, on the recovery of the Memory market, yes? So the Memory is still very much driven by immersion. Of course, we are seeing with the increased number of EUV systems in Logics on cannibalization because of multiple patterning schemes that will actually move on to single patterning EUV schemes.
Now -- so if we would not see a recovery of the Memory business, which I do not expect, because we do expect recovery, clearly, the Deep UV units would be down. But it's really the timing of the Memory recovery that will determine how much of the Deep UV units we are going to see this year. As I said, it is really hinging on the timing of the Memory recovery.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next question, Alexander Duval.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexander Duval, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alex from Goldman Sachs. I just wanted to ask or clarify on the extra R&D and SG&A for the first quarter that you've guided to versus where the street was? And just wondered if you could help decompose a bit the most important drivers and sort of what underpins them? For example, to what extent is this more about investing in faster cycle times for those 50 or 45 to 50 units in '22 -- '21? To what extent is it about increasing functionality of future EUV versions as we move beyond the 3400C? And to what extent does it hinge on any other key factors?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So on R&D, last quarter, we were at EUR 516 million, this quarter, we're guiding EUR 550 million. And I think that the vast majority of that increase is labor cost increase. As we mentioned before, at this stage, we have about a capacity that we think we need in order to accomplish the R&D objectives that we have, which are all of the things that you just mentioned, but primarily focused on the Low-NA, High-NA road map, multibeam, but also a number of developments in Deep UV, obviously.
So we think we have the capacity that we need in order to get that done. And that's why we said on previous calls, expect the going out rate for the fourth quarter to be the basis. And then obviously, it needs to be, what we call, inflation-adjusted, which is obviously linked to wage increases for that. And that's what you see. So the 6% increase from EUR 516 million to EUR 550 million really is primarily the wage increase on the R&D department.
In terms of SG&A, SG&A, I think is modeled at EUR 140 million which is I think very much in line with what you saw in previous quarters. Q4 had a little bit of a spike. There was some accounting adjustments in there in Q4 that had a little impact. And also we're in the process of implementing a new IT system, which has some impact on the SG&A number. But those are small things. But the guidance of EUR 140 million I think is pretty much in line with what we were in previous quarters, and obviously, there to the wage impact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. I think on the wage impact, don't think we give our people 10% wage increase because they will probably raise a lot of questions when people start listening to this call, but it's the combination of the normally inflationary wage increase and the fact that of course we added people in 2019. So you see the full year effect now of that growth in R&D in 2020, which actually happened throughout 2019. But now you see the full year wage impact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next question is from Joe Quatrochi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Michael Quatrochi, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. It's Wells Fargo. I had a question on the Memory side. I know that ASML has historically been more tied to DRAM than NAND. So I was hoping you could kind of help us kind of parse out the comments that you've made in terms of the recovery and seeing potentially improve bookings kind of looking into 2Q. Is that more of a NAND Flash comment? Or should we think about that from a DRAM perspective?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. I think if you split the DRAM and NAND, and I only -- like I said, the proxy that we have is basically looking at some utilization data. I think it is first noticeable in 3D NAND. I also think the slope of the recovery is a bit more aggressive in NAND than in DRAM, but they are both there. Having said that, I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that customers were creating underutilization in order to make sure that they could rebalance the supply and the demand in the Memory space sooner. That underutilization correction was also deeper in 3D NAND. So it was also not a big surprise that, of course, the return slope back up is also a bit steeper. So -- but that's where we are. I think 3D NAND started a bit earlier, it's a bit steeper slope, but both are trending in the upward direction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Michael Quatrochi, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, that's helpful. And then just for the March quarter guide, I was wondering in the past, you guys have given us kind of the EUV shipment and revenue expectation for the quarter. So I was curious if you could give us that for the March quarter? Because I know that there's 4 shipment systems rather that are included from 2019. And then maybe just any thoughts on the cadence for 2020 just now, given that the 3400C is available for the full year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. I think we've indicated in the past that as soon as we really see that EUV is, in essence, going into high-volume manufacturing and also at a point where we can take revenue upon shipment that that would be the time where we're no longer going to give separate guidance on EUV shipments. So that is clearly the case by now. So that's the reason why, starting this year, we no longer do that.
What we do, do, however, is continue to indicate, at least for 2020, for the full year, we giving an indication of the euro value and also the number of units for EUV for the full year. And of course, we will report quarter-by-quarter. We will report to you what the euro number and the unit number of that will be.
As it relates to your second question on how is it distributed over the year, it's not completely evenly distributed. It's a little bit tilted towards the second half, but only -- but modestly so. So it's not as exacerbated, if you like, as we had it in 2019. There's a better balance, but it is still a little bit tilted towards the second half of 2020.

Next question, Janardan Menon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Janardan Nedyam Menon, Liberum Capital Limited, Research Division - Technology Analyst [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's Janardan Menon from Liberum. I just had two follow-ups on the Logic side, especially on the EUV front -- sorry, on the DUV front. So if I take your growth number for this year, just calculating EUV revenues alone, you're going from EUR 2.8 billion to EUR 4.5 billion. I'm assuming that much of that is going to be Logic shipments. And so if I put that EUR 1.7 billion of additional revenue, which, on the Logic revenue of EUR 6.6 billion last year, that's about 25% of additional growth in Logic for this year. I'm just wondering given that, DUV shipments would probably come down during the year, what kind of a decline in DUV are we looking at? Is it 3 or 4 units, in which case, you will still be growing your Logic revenues at about 20% or higher? Or will the DUV drop a bit more than that and you could be sort of in the 10% to 20% range of growth on your Logic side?
And a short follow-up is on the EUV capacity. Given that you're seeing so much of demand for EUV right now, and you're saying that in 2020, it's more a capacity issue, otherwise, you probably could ship 50 units. What can you do to add capacity further into 2022 if this kind of strength, and especially if the Memory market -- the DRAM market comes in more strongly for EUV in 2022 and the Logic strength continues? Is there a scope to further reduce cycle time to take your unit shipments above 50? Or can you use some of the bays in your High-NA new facility for Low-NA systems, if that were to be required? Is there a way you can go above 50 units by 2022?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me take the first question and then Peter can go into the second question. If you piece together the data points that we gave you, I think you can find sort of an answer to your first question. So as Peter said in the video, we're looking at a double-digit growth. If you do that math and you have a number that you arrive at. And then we gave you 2 other important components. On the one hand, indeed, as you mentioned, the EUR 4.5 billion for EUV, and also on this call, gave you the 20% increase over the installed base, which would get you to approximately EUR 3.4 billion. So then you can sort of calculate where DUV and apps combined where they would land for the year. I think that's what you're looking. And of course, as Peter said, it will be dependent upon the timing and the extent of the recovery, but we believe that the number that you derive in that way is a safe number to go by with some potential obviously if the Memory recovery is significant and timing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Peter, second question on...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Second question on -- when you look at the EUV capacity that we currently have and like I said, it will be driven by cycle time reduction because the lead time reduction for capacity adds is longer. Yes, for 2020 -- beyond 2021, we are looking to bring the output capability above 50. Now -- which is what we're doing today is really looking at how much should that be. If we have to go over 60, we probably need to extend square meters of production capacity at ASML and at suppliers, which could be, like you said, using production facilities that we're currently building for High-NA, use that for temporary use in a Low-NA. Although, we'd like to prevent that because you have been here, Janardan, I mean these bays are different, the high-NA bays are different than the Low-NA bays. So it would mean some extra cost, but if push comes to shove, you could probably do that. But I think we can -- with our cycle time, probably we can go over 50. But I think it will be very difficult to go over 60. So if we have to go over 60, then we probably need to quickly add some manufacturing capacity at ASML and at the supply chain.

Next question is Amit Harchandani.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit B. Harchandani, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Analyst [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amit Harchandani from Citi. A couple, if I may. The first question goes back to the demand for EUV. You've talked about obviously the capacity for 2021. In terms of the drivers of demand from your customers, what really do you think is changing or accelerating from a customer standpoint? Is it the number of layers of adoption? Is it the base of guidance down the nodes? Is it their end customers' push? Could you give us a sense for what really do you think is driving this optimism and acceleration towards the number that you've talked about for 2021 from a customer standpoint? And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Amit, I mean the easy answer is all of the above. Yes, we are seeing increase of lay account. The fact that EUV works also gives the customer the confidence on their road map and when they get confidence on the road map, you see a cadence change, there's a push, maybe a pull-in, yes? But also I think the discussion that we're having with customers and customers are having with us, although without going to very specific customer details, we will never do that, it's very clear that the number of tape-outs and the request from their customers, our customers' customers on different types of end applications is going up. So it is basically the combination of those 3 things, I mean you've mentioned them all. And that's what it is. And I think we are responding to what our customers are asking us based on those 3 drivers, and this is why we come to the problem of more of a capacity issue in 2021 than demand issue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit B. Harchandani, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Analyst [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And secondly, if I may, could you maybe give us your latest thoughts on how you're thinking about demand from indigenous customers in China. There's obviously news flow around the EUV tool, and you've commented on that very clearly. But more broadly, as you think of your 2020 guidance and 2021, things have changed a bit since November 2018. Any clarity on demand from indigenous China, the various end markets? And what are baked into your assumptions right now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. I think things have of course changed with markets change and -- since November 2018. But I would say on China, we are pretty much on target in terms of the strategic rollout, especially in the Memory space. In Logic, and it's not so much leading-edge Logic, it's more the mature Logic systems. I think our current assessment of the market is a bit higher than it was at 2018. So if anything at the leading-edge, we're on plan. On the trailing actually, the more mature technology, I do see -- we see an upside, but no downside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next question, Achal Sultania.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit B. Harchandani, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Analyst [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's Achal from Crédit Suisse. Roger, maybe on EUV services gross margins, just trying to understand like how much of a headwind it has been on -- at a group level in 2019. Obviously, you made a comment that it will get to -- it will still be loss-making this year. But basically, we have improvement through the year. So I'm just trying to understand how much of it has been already a headwind in '19? And then how quickly can that business ramp up towards a 40%, 45% services gross margins like you have most likely in DUV? Does it take 2 years, 3 years? Any color on that would be helpful.
And then secondly, on the mix, when you talk about this 45 to 50 capacity for EUV in 2021, can you help us understand like obviously Logic is a -- foundry is a big part of that number. But what are you hearing from Logic and DRAM customers in terms of the unit breakdown of that 45 to 50 unit number?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you. So on the gross margin impact of EUV service, that was around 2% for 2019. So that's the gross margin impact of that in 2019. As I mentioned to you, we do see it's coming to a positive number in the course of this year. I expect it to be at least Q4, maybe even before that that it will turn positive.
Before we have EUV service gross margin at the corporate gross margin level, I think we're probably 2, 3 years away from that. But the aspiration clearly is there to have it at that stage in that time frame.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And on the split, the 45- to 50-unit split, I can kind of give you -- I'm not going to give you any details, but the majority and I mean the -- it's above the 50% is going to go to the Logic space. So we're still dominated by Logic. But clearly, the 2021 numbers for DRAM are -- will go up as logical. I mean we have -- in the Logic space, we have several customers, in the DRAM space, we still have one so that's also an issue that will drive the division between Logic and between DRAM. But maybe it's going to be significantly above 50% is going to be Logic.

Next question, Adithya Metuku.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adithya Satyanarayana Metuku, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's Bank of America. I had two questions. Firstly, just thinking about the Memory demand as we go through this year and into next year. Obviously, when we look at the last [2] years, going into 2018, we had a very strong increase. We had a doubling in '17 and then another 50% increase in revenues from Memory customers in '18. Now when you look at the next 2 years, obviously things may be a little different. And I know it's very difficult to give a pinpoint number, but I just wondered what do you have, in your scenarios, internally? Where do you see -- if Memory was to come back in 1Q? Where do you see Memory revenues for this year? And if it were to come back in 3Q, where do you see that coming? Any color that you can give us to help us get a rough sense of where we might end up would be very helpful.
And then secondly, just a question for Roger, just on OpEx. Just wondered if you could confirm whether the OpEx annualizing 1Q number would be a good proxy for the full year or whether there is anything else we need to think about.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Well, I think on the question on the Memory demand, I did give you some indication. I can repeat myself. But when I look at -- the best proxy we have is to just look at how our machines are being used. And that's why I said, I do believe that in the first half, and it's a bit difficult to understand the exact timing or to gauge the exact timing. They will be in the first half, I think our customers will come back to this more healthy supply/demand balance, and they will see this coming so they will place orders. So for us, it's going to be -- likely going to be a second half event. But having said that, I mean 2019 was of course a weak Memory market for us, also the first half of 2020 could be not very strong as Roger indicated. But when it come back to the second half, we will have an impact on our business, also on our financial performance.
But when the Memory goes -- comes back, then I think you need to look into 2021. I think I said it earlier, 2020, we do see strong EUV demand. I see no reason why the demand of our customers for leading-edge products in the Memory space, 5 nanometer will kick in then we will go down. But when the Memory recovery starts in the second half of the year, for us, is we'll extend it to 2021. So you would then have had effectively 1.5 years of a Memory downturn, which I think historically is not long and not short either. So it's just -- it all seems to fit, and this is the kind of call that I can give you based on top of what I already said.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And Adithya, on your questions on the -- on OpEx, indeed, I can confirm that that what we have sort of EUR 550 million R&D and the EUR 140 million for SG&A. Those are good run rates for the quarters in this year.

Next question, Sandeep Deshpande.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandeep Sudhir Deshpande, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Research Analyst [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sandeep Deshpande at JPMorgan. Most of my questions have been answered, but just actually a clarification, Peter. Firstly, on whenever this Memory recovery occurs, I mean you can see how the customer utilization is doing. Your exposure to NAND is lower than your exposure in DRAM. But do you see that NAND utilization is rising faster than DRAM more or vice versa at this point because that will determine the timing of when your orders come in?
And then secondly, regarding these -- the multibeam tools that you're working on, you think -- at this point, is the view that these will begin shipping in 2021 and that's the -- that there could be even further accretion to the margin in 2021?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All right. I think I will do the Memory recovery. Like I said earlier, with the slope of the utilization recovery is a bit faster, a bit steeper for 3D NAND, but it also come from a deeper point. So in that sense -- and yes, we have, as you mentioned, less exposure to the 3D NAND market, but 3D NAND market needs a lot of exposures. So I mean this is what we are accounting, and this is what we are seeing. So I think NAND probably rising a bit faster, I think that could be the conclusion.
And sorry, sorry, second part was?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandeep Sudhir Deshpande, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Research Analyst [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second part was on the gross margin and multi-beam tools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh, the multibeam tools. Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And indeed, multibeam, as I mentioned, multibeam is expected to be a high-margin product. So to the extent that when it will go into commercial application, and that is expected for 2021, we do believe that it will be accretive to our gross margin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roger, (inaudible) if you look at multi -- as you look at an e-beam tool, it's a machine but it's very much -- it is compute power. So there's a lot of software also that's why margins are generally higher in e-beam space than in the lithography space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next question, Aleksander Peterc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aleksander Peterc, Societe Generale Cross Asset Research - Equity Analyst [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's Alex from SocGen. I'd just like to understand, as you now contemplate 45 to 50 EUV units in '21, does this, in any meaningful way, accelerate your path to higher gross margins, more -- closer to DUV for your EUV business overall? Or there's nothing changed in terms of your gross margin scenario for this business unit? And then just briefly, your comment regarding the timing of free cash flow generation. It looks like over the next 3 years, you will have an acceleration in free cash flow generation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen, ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. So let's first talk about the gross margin for EUV. I do believe a further increase in numbers will improve our gross margin for 3 reasons. One is obvious, right? To the extent that, given the capacity that we have, we have a higher output, of course, your fixed cost coverage will improve. And as we mentioned, the increase in capacity will be achieved by reducing cycle time and will not be achieved by further Capex. So that's why more units will result in gross margin improvement. That's one element.
The second element is to the extent that we have more of these tools in the fields, that also means that our service margin will, in all likelihood, improve because the number of -- the more tools we have in one location, the more efficiency we have in having our service crews there. So then the efficiency per tool will further increase.
And thirdly, not necessarily related to the number of units, but since you talked specifically to 2021, as I mentioned, that would also see the introduction of the successor to the 3400C, which, again, we are hopeful will bring such value to our customers that the gross margin will benefit from that. So yes, a number of reasons why I think -- why we believe gross margin for EUV will continue to further improve through 2021 and beyond.
On the free cash flow question, I think that is right as well. So I mentioned to you that in the very short term, the working capital burden that we have from further growing to, let's say, this capacity level that we talked about will be there. Because given the cycle time, it will mean that we have to take significantly more inventory on-board to get it done. But then, at a certain stage, you will see the offsetting factor of the fact that cycle times get reduced.
So I think in this 1-year window, you will see a spike and then a leveling off as a result of the reduction of the cycle time. And as I also mentioned, we do want to get down payments more as the default in our commercial model. And that should also at some stage, lead to an offset in the working capital burden.

We have time for one last question. If you're unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations department. Now, operator, may we have the last caller, please?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, sir. Mitch Steves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Toshiro Steves, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RBC Capital Markets. Most of my questions answered, but I just want to clarify a couple of small points. So first of all, based on the tone of this call, it sounds like 2021 will probably be an accelerated growth year relative to 2020? I want to make sure that that's a reasonable assumption?
And then secondly, I realize you guys can't time the exact recovery of Memory. But from a historical perspective, when you look at when the Memory market recovers, what type of sequential growth you expect in the initial first batch of recovery if I look at Q-over-Q number?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink, ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I think the second question is always impossible to answer. I mean it is a -- you could say the Memory business is quite different than it was a couple of years ago. I mean 6 players in 3D NAND, 3 in DRAM, so those patents will also be a function of the composition of that market and the individual position of those companies in that market. So that's really, really difficult to use historical rates as a proxy for what's going to happen now.
I think yes, 2021 could be an accelerated growth year. However, Roger said it, I mean even without the assumption on the recovery of the Memory market and the growth of the Memory market, we'll always see a double-digit growth here this year based on Logic and on the Installed Base Management. On top of that, we could see a recovery of the Memory market. So I think you could see an acceleration this year also. Now that's not for the full year, all right, granted, because we do expect it in the second half. So -- but it will definitely continue. Like I said earlier, once this Memory market recovers, it doesn't recover for 2 quarters. I mean it recovers for a longer period, like it always does on top of the Logic market. So I think we're looking forward to some acceleration.
